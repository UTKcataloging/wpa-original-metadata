  <wpa:narrative>[15BY139] Indeterminate infant in poor condition, extended on back with head to SW. Lower half has been disturbed by 15BY140 or 15BY141 and femora reburied with long bones of 15BY141 at right of 15BY140. [15BY140] Senile female in fair condition, extended on back with head to SW. Skeleton appears to be intrusive to 15BY139 and 15BY141; however, it is badly disturbed. Ribs, right pelvis, right leg, right arm, and scapulae still articulated--vertebrae, left pelvis, sacrum, left forearm, and left leg disarticulated and disturbed. [15BY141] Indeterminate adult in poor condition, extended on back with head to NE. Apparently disturbed when 15BY140 was let into pit. Long bones, except left humerus, bundled up with femora of 15BY139 and buried compactly alongside 15BY140.</wpa:narrative>
