  <wpa:narrative>[16BY144] Indeterminate infant in fair condition, extended on back with head to west. Pit filled with dark mixed earth first showed at base of Level 2. Bones lay on subsoil. Pit is precedent to pit of 16BY145, both pits run together. Soil of 16BY145 pit blacker and showed distinctly as intrusion. About 0.1' above chest was small green stone celt. Possibly not directly associated with burial but simply put in pit. Precedent post hole just north of skull and just north of leg is precedent post hole, leg has slumped into post hole. Post hole definitely precedent. [16BY145] Indeterminate infant in fair condition, extended on back with head to west. Pit filled with humic earth, is intrusive to 16BY144. Skull very slightly tipped to right and vertebrae somewhat shifted to right. Bones lay on subsoil. [16BY146] Indeterminate infant in poor condition, extended on back with head to west.
