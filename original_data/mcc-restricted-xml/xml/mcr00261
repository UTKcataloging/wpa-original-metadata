  <wpa:narrative>[6BN87] Adult male in good condition. Complete burial but bones broken. Fully flexed on left side, face north, right arm folded with hand near chin, feet near pelvis, oriented head to west. This burial has dog at head, bones in rather peculiar state of preservation -- check dog bones for calcination. [6BN88] Indeterminate adult dog burial. Partly flexed on right side, head oriented to south. Burial complete, check 6BN87 - fear photo ruined. [6BN89] Indeterminate adult in fair condition. Head oriented to SW. Probably disturbed by intrusion of burial 6BN87 - The associations are questionable - nay - even doubtful.</wpa:narrative>
