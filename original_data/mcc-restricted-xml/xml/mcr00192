  <wpa:narrative>[9BN73] This burial lay beneath 9BN51-52. It was very fragmentary. There were no artifacts. Can't decide if its an old child or a young juvenile. [9BN74] Lay at the base of Stratum II. It's vertebrae, sacrum, and the skull position indicate that the original position was a sitting one with the torso erect. The right leg is extended in front of the skeleton and the tibia is bent upwards from the knee. The left leg is disturbed but seems to have been flexed back underneath the femur and to the left. The beads were apparently around the individual's neck. The banner stone lay on the left humerus.</wpa:narrative>
