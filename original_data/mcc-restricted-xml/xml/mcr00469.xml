  <wpa:narrative>Mature female in poor condition, fully flexed on left side with head to east. There is a possibility that this burial is precedent to the house, and that the torso and skull have been disturbed by intrusive postmolds and pit. The legs and pelvis give every indication of having been interred in the flesh. The disturbances in this area are so erratic that it is impossible to determine the status of the burial. The stones in the pit lay around and over the burial. If this were an origianl burial pit for a flexed interment, the outlines would have been obliterated by subsequent pit and postmold intrusions. It is possible that the burial is inclusive in the house and that the three postmolds were let in later. However, three intrusive postmolds supply a definite suggestion that the house is intrusive--at least it is good physical evidence of intrusion whether or not the burial was actually precedent. Reference to photograph and sketch show that one post was dug through the face of the skull. The post in front of the torso disturbed the arms slightly and the fill of the post contained fragments of bone. The post hole which disturbed the pelvis and probably the lumbar region also contained fragments of bone from the skeleton-- assuming that they were intrusive to the skeleton. As shown in the sketch, a number of water-worn stones lay in the fill of the pit above the skeleton. </wpa:narrative>
