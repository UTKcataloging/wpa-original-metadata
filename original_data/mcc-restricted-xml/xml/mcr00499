  <wpa:narrative>[16BY189] Adult female in poor condition, extended on right side with head to SW. Lay under 16BY188, precedent to it and disturbed by it. Bones lay on subsoil except skull. Pit could not be traced under 16BY188. Skull on right side, left scapula, clavicle in place. Parts of pelvis and legs in place. Legs very slightly bent at knees. Right humerus and part of radius over skull--apparently disturbed by 16BY188. 16BY190 seems to be disturbed by 16BY189, and is thus precedent to it. Skull 0.1' higher than pelvis. [16BY190] Indeterminate adult in poor condition, a disturbed bone pile. Same pit as 16BY189. Pit could not be traced horizontally under 188 but was definitely observed to be present. Burial consists of crushed skull base up, several long bones and ribs around skull. As it seems to be slightly below 16BY189 and while it is directly below 16BY188, which was 0.2' above it; it seems likely that it (16BY190) is the earliest burial. It is the most disturbed of the group. No sherds were found below the level of 16BY188. </wpa:narrative>
