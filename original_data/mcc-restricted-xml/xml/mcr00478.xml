  <wpa:narrative>[16BY140] Senile female in good condition, extended on back with head to NW. Pit could not be traced higher than Level 2, but seems to have originated at base of plow zone. Pit filled with dark mixed humic soil. 16BY140 lies in upper part of pit along northeast side. Skull on right side. Right arm extended at side. Left arm missing. Femora are displaced, one lying near left side, one at right angles to pelvis. This would appear to be earlier than 16BY141, 16BY142 but it lies above and over lower burials. [16BY141] Mature female in good condition, extended on back with head to NW. Pit from Level 2 with dark mixed humic soil. Pit may originate at base of plowzone though this is not certain. 16BY141 must be earlier than16BY140 as ribs extend under 16BY140. Burial 141 is subsequent to 16BY143 as this pit extends under 141. Bones of 141 lay on subsoil except where over 16BY143. Neck arched up and head tipped back so that chin is higher than frontal. Ribs on left slumped outward, right ribs arched up in nearly normal position. Right radius only present and proximal end 0.7' above distal end. Hand somewhat disturbed but seems in main to be in articulation. Left radius and ulna seem to be in articulation, also hand. Pelvis lower (0.1'-0.2') than feet and skull, apparently settled into pit of 16BY143. [16BY142] Indeterminate infant in fair condition, extended on back with head to NW. In same pit as 16BY141. Lay between femora of 16BY141, skull almost touching pubic bones. Bones lay on fill of pit 16BY143. Appears to be on back, face up. Arms and legs somewhat disturbed but must be extended. Left leg seems to be piled beside left side. Ribs somewhat scattered and arms seem to be extended. </wpa:narrative>
