  <wpa:narrative>Mature male in fair condition, extended on back with head to west. Pit from below Feature 21A, was designated as Feature 24. Top filled with ash, burned clay, charcoal; below pit was filled with yellow clay and some humic above bones; at lower legs, pelvis, and right shoulder were three areas of burned oak slabs. Wood at legs was 0.3' above bones. Neither bones nor clay were burned. Bones lie very slightly above subsoil, skull on right side, face right. Vertebrae in place except for cervicals. Two articles lay over left scapula--this may be rodent disturbance--all ribs in place. Hands somewhat misplaced but seem to be in articulation. Right foot in articulation. Left foot disturbed--may be natural slumping. Rest of bones in position. Left ilium higher than right. </wpa:narrative>
