  <wpa:narrative>[6BN142] Adult male in good condition with all bones present although somewhat broken. Fully flexed on back, vertebrae straight, knee flexed to chin, feet and hands at pelvis, arm flexed at elbow with extended humerus, head oriented to east. This individual was tightly flexed and associated with what seems to have been a rattle or pouch, that is, a group of small pebbles and turtle shell. Again no pit was observable, although its presence may simply have been missed. [6BN143] Juvenile male in good condition and complete. Fully flexed on ventral side, skull on right side, legs tightly flexed back, right arm extended, left arm extended with back, hands at pelvis, head oriented to west. Tightly flexed individual lying on ventral side, skull twisted to one side - information on pit is negative although presence could be suspected.</wpa:narrative>
