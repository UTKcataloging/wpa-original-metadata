  <wpa:narrative>[Burial 9BN40] Adult male in good condition. Partly flexed, flesh, burial on back, arms extended, knees spread, feet joined at pelvis, oriented head to NE. This burial is in a rather odd position. It lies directly upon the bones of another (9BN59) individual, a tibia of which shows beneath the right ribs. [Burial 9BN41] Mature male in fair condition. Partly flexed, flesh, burial "sitting up", legs (?) arms loosely flexed, oriented head to west. This burial was badly broken up and some of the bones scattered. This "sitting up" position seems to be peculiar to this site, this being the third case observed here. [9BN42] Mature male in fair condition. Partly flexed, flesh, burial on ventral side, legs to left, arms(?), oriented head to east. This burial was covered with fire and the legs and arms were partially burnt away. [9BN43] Indeterminate in poor condition. Semi-flexed, flesh, burial half sitting up, knees up, arms flexed over torso, oriented head to NW. This burial lay under 9BN42 and probably was disturbed at the time it was interred. It was in a semi "sitting" position.</wpa:narrative>
