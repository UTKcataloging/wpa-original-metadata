  <wpa:narrative>An adult female in good condition, extended on back with head to NW. This burial lay in a stone box of limestone slabs laid on end for the sides, and other slabs laid on top. On the top of this box over the stone was burial 16BY7. About 0.1' to 0.2' of humic soil lay between 16BY7 and 16BY22. There was no evidence of more than one pit which was discovered at datum depth 9.8, about the top of Level 2. It is suggested that 16BY7 may have been purposely placed in the reopened pit.</wpa:narrative>
