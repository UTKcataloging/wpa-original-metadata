  <wpa:narrative> The plan of this burial shall have to be derived from the photograph (God grant its a good one). This burial lay with a tremendous pile of beigaben over it and red ochre shown among the artifacts. It was taken up "in toto" with great success and then the entire outfit was unceremoniously and with great force deposited on the floor of the truck where it became a mass of dirt, artifacts, etc. I hope and believe that the photograph will make up for the lack of the drawing. There are a large number of deer cammon bones in the heap which are unworked. Yet they lay with the worked material. It is my belief that they are purposefully placed with the artifacts.</wpa:narrative>
