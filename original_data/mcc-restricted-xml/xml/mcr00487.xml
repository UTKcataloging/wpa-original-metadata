  <wpa:narrative>[16BY152] Indeterminate child in fair condition, extended on back with head to NW. Pit showed at base of plowzone as precedent to 16BY153, fill with dark mixed humus and clay. Burial 16BY153 is intrusive to 16BY152. Skull seems originally to have been on right side and posthumously slumped so that face is down, occiput up. Mandible bottom up but in articulation with glenoid fossa. Most of lower torso missing. Right arm missing. Left humerus present and indicative arm was extended. Left leg under feet of 16BY153 and is extended. Right leg mainly gone but seems to have been extended. Scattered bones lay under legs of 16BY153. Bones lay on subsoil. [16BY153] Mature female in good condition, extended on back with head to SW. Pit from base of plowzone filled with light mixed clay and humus was intrusive to pit for 16BY152. Feet of 16BY153 lay over 16BY152. Pit for 16BY153 definitely cut into and disturbed 16BY152. Bones lay on subsoil. Skull tipped back, resting on lambdoidal region. Mandible displaced. Cervical vertebrae displaced, possibly by rodents. No shifting of other bones. (See notebook for description page 151). Disturbance of cervical vertebrae may well be from intrusive post holes. </wpa:narrative>
