  <wpa:narrative>[16BY158] Juvenile female in fair condition, extended on back with head to NW. Apparently a simultaneous burial-- pit very narrow and shoulders of skeletons hunched forward to force them into pit. No intervening fill between bones--pelvis practically on same level, skulls and legs partially superimposed. Pit filled with mixed black soil including small particles of burned clay and charcoal. [16BY159] Mature female in fair condition, extended on back with head to NW. See form for 16BY158 for details. Four or five phalanges scattered under left shoulder as though carried by rodents or roots.</wpa:narrative>
