  <wpa:narrative>[16BY89] Indeterminate child in good condition, extended on back with head to NE. This burial lay in the center of the south half of Feature 9. The pit bellied below the top, and in a rather deep belly, bundle burial 16BY108 was laid. There were several rocks laid in the side of the pit resting on the bottom of the pit. The matrix of the pit was dark humic soil full of ash, charcoal, etc. The pit was inclusive in Feature 9. It would seem from the relative condition of the bones that while the two burials may have been interred simultaneously in this pit that 16BY108 was either buried in this pit or some other at a previous time. 16BY108 is fragmentary and a reburial. [16BY108] Indeterminate juvenile in poor condition, bones in a pile. This was a fragmentary bundle burial in a hollow of the pit of 16BY89. The pit was regular in outline at the floor of Feature 9. The bones were in very poor condition. There seemed to be no difference in the matrix surrounding this burial and that around 16BY89. It may have been that 16BY108 was previous to 16BY89 and was pushed back to the side of the pit to make place for 16BY89. </wpa:narrative>
