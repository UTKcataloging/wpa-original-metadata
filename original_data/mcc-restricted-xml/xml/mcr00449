  <wpa:narrative>[16BY44] Mature male in good condition, extended on back with head to SW. Apparently buried simultaneously with and almost directly over 16BY45. Left legs and pelvis directly superimposed. Right legs, torso, arms and skull of 16BY44 slightly to left and above 16BY45. Hands and feet directly superimposed with about 0.1' infiltrated dirt intervening. Mandible of 16BY44 shifted or dropped down away from skull. Skull and left foot slightly disturbed as though raked by plow--pit filled with mottled clay and humus, flecks of charcoal and ash. [16BY45] Adult male in good condition, extended on back with head to SW. Almost directly under 16BY44. FS 828, metapodial awl, was between the legs of both skeletons but almost too low to be physically associated with 16BY44. Some intervening fill between torsos, probably infiltrated--no soil between superimposed knees. Pit filled with mottled clay and humus, some ash. </wpa:narrative>
