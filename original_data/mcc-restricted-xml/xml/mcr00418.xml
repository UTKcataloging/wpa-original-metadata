  <wpa:narrative>[15BY134] Mature male in poor condition, extended on back with head to NW. Buried alongside 15BY135--possible that 15BY134 is precedent to 15BY135, as the latter tends to encroach upon 15BY134. The burials were made in the disturbed soil of a house pit so that outlines can't be discerned. The porosity of the soil about the skeletons suggests a general area of pit disturbance. The burials are pretty definitely intrusive to the house pit--having cut through some burned clay. [15BY135] Adult male in fair condition, extended on back with head to SE. No pit discernable except by porosity of disturbed soil about burials; burials let into a house pit. It is possibly a later intrusive burial to 15BY134. It is about 0.3' higher.</wpa:narrative>
