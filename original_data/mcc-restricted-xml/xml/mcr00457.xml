  <wpa:narrative>[16BY61] Adult female in good condition, extended on back with head to WNW. Pit from plowzone filled with fairly light mixed soil. Pit outlines not defineable on north side. Bones lay directly over 16BY62 and in contact with them. 61 seems to be later and to have disturbed somewhat earlier burial. Right ulna missing. NOTE: These do not seem to be simultaneous burials. Lumbar vertebrae slumped to left, to lie left of vertebrae of 62. Feet of 61 and 62 are piled together. [16BY62] Adult female in fair condition, extended on back with head to WNW. Pit seems to be same as 16BY61. Lay directly below and touching 16BY61. Skull and cervical vertebrae disturbed but seem to have been in articulation and pushed about 0.6' to WNW in line of body. Pelvis completely gone and all vertebrae but 3 lumbar. Ribs fair. This is, I believe, a burial very shortly before 16BY61, 61disturbing it while still partly fleshed.</wpa:narrative>
