  <wpa:narrative>Large quantity of grave goods. Turkey bones and flint may be material. Most of tools are utilitarian. It will be noted that the points found with this burial are of a type with those of one of the Woodland burials of 7HY5. They are certainly distinctive. These were not photographed as they lay under the bulk of the grave goods. They lay, however, sandwiched together and beside one another, etc., as if they had been in a quiver or case. Chips of flint and turkey bones may have been material for the Indian to fashion more artifacts with on the the other side of the Styx. Or the turkey bones may represent a food offering. I lean to the first explanation. </wpa:narrative>
  <wpa:comments>Institution has illustration of burial on file. Photograph 15BN3 has the same description as this one, and shows a close-up of the grave goods.</wpa:comments>
