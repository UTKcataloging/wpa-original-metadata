  <wpa:narrative>Indeterminate infant in fair condition, extended on right side with head to SSW. Pit probably inclusive in Feature 31. Pit first showed at floor. 16BY175 seems to be later than 16BY176. Pit very small and filled with clay and some humus. Four large sherds lay along sides of pit. Top of sherds touch sides of pit, bottoms out from sides and touch burial. Burial is of an extremely small infant. Seemed to be on right side with arms at sides, legs semi-extended. Bones lay on bottom of pit.</wpa:narrative>
