  <wpa:narrative>[15BY66] Mature male in poor condition, extended on back with head to NW. 15BY67 apparently a contemporary interment laid in over the left arm and side of 15BY66. Upper fill of pit contained considerable fragmentary burned clay and charcoal. F.S. 926 and 927 do not show in the photograph because they were beneath 15BY67 and were not found until the skeletons were removed. The spear point (F.S. 926) lay under the left forearm of 15BY66 and pointed toward the head. The eight triangular projectile points (F.S. 927) were grouped, the points toward the feet, as if they had been attached to arrows in a quiver. [15BY67] Indeterminate child in poor condition, extended on back with head to NW.</wpa:narrative>
