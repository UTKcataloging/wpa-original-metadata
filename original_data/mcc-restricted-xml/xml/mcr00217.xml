  <wpa:narrative>[1BN10] Adult female in good condition, extended with head to the SE, deposited on back. These burials have been disturbed. Numbers 10 and 11 have suffered loss of lower legs - possibly by intrusion of 1BN8 which ws itself later disturbed and scattered - probably by white disturbance. Complete except for loss of lower legs and part of left femur. [1BN11] Adult male in good condition, extended with head to southeast, deposited on back, arms across stomach. [1BN12] Indeterminate child in good condition, partly flexed with head to west, deposited on left side and back. Pelvis broken and fragmentary, skull crushed. Apparently thrown on top of other burials which were more or less "laid out". [1BN13] Indeterminate child in fair condition, extended with head to SE, deposited on left side. All bones represented but very broken, fragmentary.</wpa:narrative>
