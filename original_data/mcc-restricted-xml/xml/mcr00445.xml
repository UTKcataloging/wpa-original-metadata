  <wpa:narrative>[16BY37] Mature female in good condition, partly flexed on right, head to west. Same pit as burials 38, 39. Buried earlier than either. Infant apparently buried against side of pit partially reclining on right side. Skull and right arm left at upper level. Most of torso slumped down about 0.7' to level of pelvis. Legs flexed right and knees up about 0.9'. 16BY42 earliest, before 16BY37, decay of 42 probably caused slumping of 37. [16BY38] Indeterminate infant in good condition, extended on back with head to west. Burial pit from plowzone filled with mixed soil. 16BY38, 16BY39 lay above 16BY37, almost touching bones of 37. It seems possible that these two infants may have been buried at the same time as16BY37. No evidence of intrusive pit into pit of 16BY37. Infants at same level as skull of 37. 42 before 37. [16BY39] Indeterminate infant in fair condition, disturbed and fragmented. Lay below 16BY38--appeared to be disturbed and may be two individuals. Skull fragments at east and west, scattered bones around 16BY38. This burial may be earlier than 38 or may be rodent disturbed as rodent bones occurred above both burials.</wpa:narrative>
