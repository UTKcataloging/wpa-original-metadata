  <wpa:narrative>[Burial 8] This burial was seemingly disarranged by another burial. The head was considerably higher than the other bones which were not wholly in anatomical order, but enough to exclude any bundle reburial. [Burial 9] Two clay bowls 11" to the north from burial and somewhat lower level (approximately 3" below body). Five inches to the west of remains a smooth, flat limestone 6" in diameter. [Burial 10] Clay below remains showed evidence of mesh. Slight traces of bark above and below the remains. Three limestone hoes and one bear jaw - associated. </wpa:narrative>
