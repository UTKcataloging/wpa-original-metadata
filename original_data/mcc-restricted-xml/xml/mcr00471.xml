  <wpa:narrative>[16BY114] Adult male in fair condition, extended on back with head to north. This burial lay directly beneath 16BY115 but probably was not interred at the same time. 16BY115 lay about 0.3' further south than 16BY114 so that the head of 16BY115 lay beneath the chin of 16BY114. 16BY114 was in a greater state of decomposition than 16BY115 and from this it is believed that it was not simultaneous interment. The pit of 16BY114 and 16BY115 was filled with humic soil in which burnt clay, charcoal and detritus was scattered. This skeleton lay on subsoil. [16BY115] Adult female in good condition, extended on back with head to north. This burial lay directly above 16BY114, touching it at several points. The right hand lay over the pelvis. Mouth is wide open probably due to posthumous shifting. The left elbow is raised to about 0.2' below the left shoulder. The right leg is slightly bent out and lays on its right side. A pathological condition is noticeable on the left tibia.</wpa:narrative>
