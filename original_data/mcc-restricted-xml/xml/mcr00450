  <wpa:narrative>Adult male in good condition, extended on back with head to SW. Apparently simultaneous with 16BY44; burial 45 almost directly under. F.S. 828, metapodial awl, was between the legs of both skeletons but almost too low to be physically associated with 16BY44. Some intervening fill between torsos, probably infiltrated--no soil between superimposed knees. Pit filled with mottled clay and humus, some ash.</wpa:narrative>
