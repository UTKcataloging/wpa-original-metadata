  <wpa:narrative>[16BY130] Adult male in good condition, fully flexed on back. This burial is the southernmost of a group of four individual flexed burials in an area of about 10' x 5'. It lay on its back with the knees raised and the arms flexed putting the hands on the shoulders. Over the left elbow lay a bowl, right side up (F.S. 2747). Below this and to the left of the pelvis was a pot with strap handles (F.S. 2748) and having a shell spoon in it (F.S. 2749). See 16BY134, 135, and 138. These are not associated but are in a group. Pit matrix of humic and clayey soil mixed. [16BY134] Adult female in good condition, partly flexed on back with head to west. This burial lay on its back with the left arm extended under the flexed legs, and the right forearm lay over the abdominal region. The skull and the right clavicle were disturbed. Matrix of pit was mixed clay and humic soil, chiefly clay. The pit, at 7.8 datum depth, was irregular and no distinct outline could be traced. The pit should have been checked for outline at a level about midway between datum depth 7.8 and 9.5, but the laborers removed the soil before the pit could be checked. [16BY135] Mature female in good condition, fully flexed on left side with head to north. This burial lay on its left side and was tightly flexed. A sinew stone (F.S. 2762) lay near the forearm, and a shell (F.S. 2763) lay on left knee. The right knee was probably raised at the time of interment because of the fact there is about 0.5' between distal end of the right femur and the proximal end of right fibula (where end would be approximately). [16BY138] Indeterminate child in fair condition, fully flexed on left side with head to east. This burial is a flexed child about 0.2 west of 16BY135. It lay in a shallow ill-defined pit. Pit fill was of mixed clayey and humic soil. The burial seems slightly disturbed, perhaps from posthumous settling. </wpa:narrative>
