  <wpa:narrative>[16BY11] Mature male in good condition, extended on back with head to WNW. Pit originated at plow line--filled with small amount of humic soils mixed with ash and light-colored silt. Skull, pelvis, hands, and right foot disturbed. The feet of 16BY11 lie about 0.3' above the knees and femur of 16BY12. Pits A and B were shallow depressions filled with organic black soil. Pit A is intrusive to burial pit for 16BY12 and precedent to burial pit for 16BY11. Pit B is precedent to pit for 16BY11. The bottom of pit A is 0.9' below the plowline. The bottom of pit B is 1.0' below the plowline. A deposit of ash, burned silt and a water-worn stone 0.5' below the plow line in pit B. [16BY12] Indeterminate child in fair condition, extended on back with head to west. Pit intrusive from plow zone; filled with grayish-black mixed soil. Strips of rotten wood lay cross-wise above the skull, pelvis, femora, and tibiae. Left leg, feet, and vertebrae disturbed by rodents or ants. A layer of rotten wood covered the skeleton from the lower ribs to the knees--a heavy strip lay across the skull and two short strips lay across the lower left leg. The wood is too fragmentary and depleted to use for dendrochronology. The wood appears to be cedar or chestnut. A thin film of soil intervenes between the bone and wood. Ants have been particularly active around the skeleton, possibly accounting for some of the shifting of the bones.</wpa:narrative>
