Flexed burial in foreground is 15BY63; it was subsequent to extended burial 15BY64 which is badly disturbed and preserved. 15BY63 is an adult male, 15BY64 is an adult of indeterminate sex. An infant, 15BY65, lies near the flexed legs of 15BY63. A small pottery vessel (F.S. 872) is associated with the infant. Square 12R2. Direction NW.</dc:title>

  <wpa:narrative>[15BY63] Adult male in good condition, fully flexed on back with head to SW. Burial apparently intrusive into an (extended?) burial immediately beneath. [15BY64] Indeterminate adult in poor condition, extended on back with head to SW. This burial was obviously the original occupant of the pit; the flexed burial 15BY63 having been laid in over the space occupied by the legs and lumbar region. Fragments of 15BY64 scattered throughout the fill of the pit. [15BY65] Indeterminate infant in poor condition. Four teeth and fragment of petrous bone. It can't be determined whether 15BY65 was laid in at the same time as either 15BY63 or 15BY64--it may even represent a separate interment adjacent to the other two burials--the outlines of the pits could not be distinguished as separate. If it were a companion burial to 15BY64, it may possibly have been disturbed by the intrusive burial 15BY63.</wpa:narrative>
