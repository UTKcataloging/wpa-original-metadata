  <wpa:narrative> Indeterminate child in fair condition, extended on back with head to west. Pit intrusive from plow zone; filled with grayish-black mixed soil. Strips of rotten wood lay cross-wise above the skull, pelvis, femora, and tibiae. Left leg, feet, and vertebrae disturbed by rodents or ants. A layer of rotten wood covered the skeleton from the lower ribs to the knees--a heavy strip lay across the skull and two short strips lay across the lower left leg. The wood is too fragmentary and depleted to use for dendrochronology. The wood appears to be cedar or chestnut. A thin film of soil intervenes between the bone and wood. Ants have been particularly active around the skeleton, possibly accounting for some of the shifting of the bones.</wpa:narrative>
