  <wpa:narrative>A circular pit filled with charred skeletal remains. Apparently cremated before being placed in mound, since the earth showed no evidence of burning. No lines could be determined that would indicate an intrusive burial, but it is possible that it was since the surface of the mound was just a little over a foot above. This burial was removed for preserving. Underneath was found the col. of a conch shell.</wpa:narrative>
