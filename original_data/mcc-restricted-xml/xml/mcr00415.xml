  <wpa:narrative>[15BY124] Adult male in fair condition, extended on back with head to NW. Buried immediately to the left of 15BY125 in the same pit--projectile points appear to have penetrated into body cavity--at least the one penetrating the lumbar vertebrae is certainly traumatic. [15BY125] Juvenile male in poor condition, extended on back with head to NW. Buried immediately to the right of 15BY124 in the same pit--interment appears to have been simultaneous.</wpa:narrative>
