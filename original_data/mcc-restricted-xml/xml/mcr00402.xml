[15BY97] Mature male in fair condition, extended on back with head to NE. Triangular projectile point imbedded between 5 and 6 rib on left side of burial 97, suggests possible cause of demise. Point of projectile is toward spine. Miscellaneous long bones and pelvis of two individuals buried along lower legs of 15BY97--possible that 15BY97 was intrusive to the two individuals (15BY100, 15BY101) which were reburied with 15BY97.
