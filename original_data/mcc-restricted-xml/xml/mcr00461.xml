  <wpa:narrative>Indeterminat infant in poor condition. This was so badly disordered that it was thought it might be a reburial. It was somewhat similar to 16BY74. The head, which had been disturbed, lay under and over a large sherd probably from the same pit. The vertebrae lay in a heap under another sherd, and beneath sherd at the north end of pit were the bones of the left lower leg. To the right of the sherd which lay over the head lay a flat rock (F.S. 1851). Other sherds (F.S. 1751)were strewn thickly in the pit over the skeleton to about 0.1' in depth. A fragment of split bone awl (F.S. 1719)came from the fill of the pit.</wpa:narrative>
