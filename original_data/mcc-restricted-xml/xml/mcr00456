  <wpa:narrative>Adult male in poor condition, extended on back with head to SW. Refer to form for 16BY56 for details concerning superposition of 56 and 57. Besides the disarrangement of the skull and mandible incidental to the interment of 56, the right foot of 57 has been slightly disturbed as though by roots or rodents. F.S. 1323 (shell beads) are definitely associated with 57. Complete exposure of 57 shows an unbroken string of the beads extending laterally under the cervical vertebrae from left to right. As noted on form for 56, there was some question as to the exact association of the beads--this doubt is now removed. F.S. 1417 (elbow pipe) fragile and crumbly--bowl had a charred cake.</wpa:narrative>
