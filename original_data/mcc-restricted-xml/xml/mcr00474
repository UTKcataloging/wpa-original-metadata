  <wpa:narrative>Adult female in good condition, extended on back with head to SW. This burial lay in the same pit as burials 110 and 111, and was not disturbed. It lay 1.2' deeper than 16BY110. The right tibia was moved about 0.1' toward the left leg. Pit matrix was of dark humic soil. 16BY121 lay on subsoil. It was unquestionably precedent to 16BY110 and 16BY111. </wpa:narrative>
