  <wpa:narrative>Indeterminat infant in good condition, extended on back with head to south. This burial was covered over with sherds from three pots and it seemed likely that at time of interment that these pots had been whole. The burial lay over a large number of sherds seemingly from one or two pots. It lay in a pit near the west side of Feature 9. It was complete except for the feet. It lay in a small pit on the bottom of the larger pit (see drawing). Matrix was dark clayey soil. Sherds under the burial lay outside up as well as did the sherds above the burial. Under the sherds below 16BY74 lay another infant burial 16BY79. The sherds below 16BY74 seem to be related to 16BY79 and not 16BY74, unless of course these are simultaneous burials, as they might be, although there is no positive evidence to support this (Also see burial 16BY75 for similarity--infant in some sort of pit with pottery associated).</wpa:narrative>
