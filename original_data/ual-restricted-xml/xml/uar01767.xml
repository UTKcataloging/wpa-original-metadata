  <wpa:narrative>Burial #4 located in 55R2 at1.90' below surface. All that remains are traces of bones. The skull is near a greenstone spade (F.S .#48). Pit is 9.20' x 2.10' x 1.35' deep. Relatively shallow pit and spade were apparently placed near the head. Note how pit outline appears to follow the contour of the body. It bulges in and out and no head or foot rests were observed. Filling was of a blueish gray clay. </wpa:narrative>
