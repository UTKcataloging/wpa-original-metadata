  <wpa:narrative>A multiple burial consisting of Burial #s 26, 27, 28, 101, &amp;102. Burial #26 is the adult fully exposed. The skull of Burial #27 (adult) can be seen below the right ribs of Burial #26. Burial #28 (infant) lies directly to the left of the left humerus of Burial #26. Burial # 101 (adult) is directly under the left side of Burial #26, and Burial #102 (juvenile) lies beneath the lower portion of Burial #26. The large plain shell-tempered pottery vessel in the foreground is F.S. #119, and the smaller effigy pottery vessel enclosed is F.S. #118.
