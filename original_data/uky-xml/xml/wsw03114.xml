  <wpa:narrative>General view of the site taken from the southwest before excavations were commenced. The corn has been removed from the field and staking partly accomplished. The trees in the background form a right angle in the center rear, those to the right bordering Pond Drain, and those to the left Cypress Creek. This site is located at the mouth of Pond Drain where it empties into Cypress Creek. The elevation of this site location above the immediately surrounding area is evident in the middle background.</wpa:narrative>
