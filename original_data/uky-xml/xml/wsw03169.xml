  <wpa:narrative>Photographed from the southeast. Indicated is the rock slab ring (Feature 4) in relation to the two truncated domes forming the walls of rock and earth ring as appears in the 30 foot profile. Note the lenses of yellow hardpan clay in both domes of the profile; tilted in the left hand dome and horizontal in the right. Note how the earth fill of the central ring cavity above the mound floor level flows in an uninterrupted trend and with scattered tilted streaks or loads into the large central subfloor pit (Feature 2). In the background is that portion of the rock ring exposed to the north of the 35 foot profile. In the upper right hand corner can be seen the platform in the trees from which all the aerial shots at this site were taken from the north. Dimly in the background are seen the bluffs of the Ohio River on the Indiana side.</wpa:narrative>
