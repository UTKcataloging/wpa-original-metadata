  <wpa:narrative>Photograph taken from the north of the subject. Indicated is the lower portion of the 90' Profile between stake R-2 on the left, and L-6 on the right. On the extreme left of this profile is show the intrusive pit Feature #21 in the same stage of exposure as shown in Photo 261BE3. To the right of this pit, with its top surface indicated by a white string, is a primary dome of bright horizontally loaded earth overlying the precedent house structure Feature #26 ... the right hand end of this has been cut away in this photograph, but profile drawing demonstrate this. This probably represents the primary mound constructed over the house structure. Atop this block, and also apparently atop this primary mound, is Tomb #48 and the skull of Burial 83BE3 in the process of excavation. On the left hand end of the photograph atop the low block of earth is the exposed Tomb #46 (Feature #41). The loose earth banked in front of the 90' Profile covers and protects a portion of the exposed house structure (Feature #26).</wpa:narrative>
