  <wpa:narrative>Photograph taken from the north of the subject. Indicated is the lower portion of the large intrusive "white" pit (feature #21) as seen in the 90' Profile. The outline of the pit is defined by a string pinned in the incised outline. As well as the top of the pit being cut away in this photograph a portion of the east side is also. Note how the line of the pit interrupts the bright colored loading of the mound fill to the right of it. The filled earth of the pit itself shows silt bands due to the differential sorting of sediments by water of percolation. Also in the center of this pit fill there is quite a patch of loaded earth suggesting that perhaps a sizeable portion of the wall caved in as a block during the refilling operations; substantiating this is the fact that these loads are standing on end rather than in their normal horizontal attitude. In the lower left hand corner of the photograph is a corner of the exposed Tomb #46.</wpa:narrative>
