  <wpa:narrative>The pieces just below the arrow are in situ. Those pieces near the pick were removed from near those in situ before workers discovered it was more than miscellaneous sherds. Unable to determine whether it was broken by pressure of earth, roots, etc., or whether it was broken and placed in mound. No associations found.</wpa:narrative>
