  <wpa:narrative>Pillar with sandstone slab on top. Shows stratigraphy of yellow sand thrown out of the Pit # 2. This sand is the hardpan underlying the old humus below the mound. Laborer suggests approximate height that sand was thrown out of pit and also suggests that some dirt had been piled up around the pit before it was dug to the bottom.</wpa:narrative>
