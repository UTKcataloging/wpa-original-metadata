  <wpa:narrative>Photograph taken from the south. Indicated in the forty foot profile to the right is the undisturbed yellow clay beneath the bottom line incised in the wall; above this and to the left is the homogenous mound fill in immediate contact with the yellow clay except at the right where a band of Old Humus remains. Above the mound fill, in the upper layer, is the loose homogenous accumulated wash from the surface of the mound above, the small inset portion of the 45' profile shows merely mound fill upon the undisturbed yellow clay. The axial profile on the north south face shows mound fill meeting the yellow clay in an irregular line suggesting digging) with an outwash skirt of accumulated erosional material above it. Note the deformation of the surface curvature to the right of the apex ... this is the crater left partly filled by pot-holers and identified as Feature #21.</wpa:narrative>
