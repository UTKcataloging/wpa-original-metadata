  <wpa:narrative>Photograph taken from the north of the subject. Indicated is the lower portion of the 90' Profile between stake R-2 on the left, and L-6 on the right. Profile is in the same stage of exposure as indicated in Photos 261 and 262BE3. On the extreme left of the photograph is the large intrusive pit (Feature #21) previously described in Photo 261. To the right of this pit an incised line with a white string in it defines a large dome of brightly loaded earth of primary character ... dome incomplete on right end where cut away. Comparison of the outer dimensions of this dome as it appears in this face with the periphery of the house structure (Feature #26) indicates them to roughly correspond. This definitely suggests a mound built over the burnt structure. Although the dome of bright colored earth described above appears to be primary in the mound construction, there is some evidence contrariwise which suggests that it is really a secondary mound. Careful examination of Photograph 363BE3 in conjunction with the 90' Profile drawing will show a low "mound" of brighter colored loading at the base of the above mentioned mound which may be the true primary structure. At the time of photographing the definition of this was not sufficiently clear to warrant incising in the profile and accordingly it is distinquished from the larger overlying mound only vaguely. The existence of this small primary structure was further substantiated in the 85' Profile where the surface of this mound on the west edge was severely fired. All this suggests a small mound built within the house structure and over the cremated remains of the floor. The burning down of the house over this fired the top of this small primary mound in part (see the 85' profile at the base of stake L-4). After the burning of the house another mound was built over it which roughly corresponded to its outer periphery. The irregular surface in the foreground is loose earth banked over the partly exposed house structure (Feature #26) for its protection.</wpa:narrative>
