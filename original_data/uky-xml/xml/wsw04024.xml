  <wpa:narrative>Underneath the west and south sides of the opened squares lay the wall outlines of Structure III, which were not visible at this stage of excavation. The charcoal and burned dirt typical of structure floors covers the exposed levels, although their contrast is not apparent in the picture. From the hole in the center had been removed the nearly complete rim section of a rather large bowl (F.S. 24, restored). The bowl had been placed upside down and the body and parts of the shoulder had been carried away by the plow. Plowed level above it extended to .6' below surface; the deepest part of the rim .3' below that. View from south. </wpa:narrative>
