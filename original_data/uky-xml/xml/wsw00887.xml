  <wpa:narrative>On January 31st, the Green River had risen so much that it was thought advisable to move part of the equipment across to the Annis Site which was about to begin. It was well that this was done, for it was impossible to move the shack, boxes, and remainder of the material until March 2nd. This 'progress photo' at close of work is given this low number to replace an unsuccessful exposure.</wpa:narrative>
