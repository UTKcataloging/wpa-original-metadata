  <wpa:narrative>View of house structure (Feature #3) while yet in the matrix, but exposed from the top by stripping of plowline, and indicated by a double line of string. In the foreground the south corner extends partially as wings to a reconstructed corner. The house floor (Feature #5) embraced within the walls of Feature #3 does not show on the horizontal exposure, but is apparent in that part of profile embraced by the foreground wings. From Notes: "Weather -- clear and sunny. Adjustment -- f 32; 1/2 second. Subject -- Feature #3. The top outline of this house structure (as exposed after the plow-line is removed) is indicated by the two chalk-lines describing a rough 25' square. The fore-ground extension of this structure (which was accidentally destroyed) is hypothetically indicated by the same method, i.e. projecting the lines of the two sides until they meet Level A between two exposed wings of foreground. Reclassified as Feature #5. Scope -- As measured on the 55' Profile: R-1 - L-7. Camera Position -- On top of large dirt pile over 98-L-2 stake". </wpa:narrative>
