  <wpa:narrative>Close-up showing very poorly how the undisturbed soil, on slope of hill, was cut into and then refilled during construction of wall. See diagram of RC 11R2, 12R2. Frames 27, 28, 29. Film 4. "Lensing" in lower half of picture is result of natural segregation of clayey and ferrous particles in the undisturbed sand. An identical segregation took place in the sand of similar nature which formed part of the artificial fill of the wall. Note lensing in large sand lens shown in 62GP1.</wpa:narrative>
