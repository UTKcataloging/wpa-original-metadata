  <wpa:narrative>Also showing in close foreground, central pit of small mound. The cuts in the lower approaches to the large mound followed a hard red clay area. The three cuts across the higher portion of the mound followed a very hard floor like dome shaped area of sandy loam. This may have been due to conditions brought about by extremely dry weather and agencys of weathering.</wpa:narrative>
