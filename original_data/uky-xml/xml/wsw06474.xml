  <wpa:narrative>Above the top line in profile 50 to 80 is that portion of the humus which was plowed. From 55 towards 50 above second line is the fill of the south wall. There was indications that the moatlike depression was dug deeper than the lower line but part of the depth was filled by the aborigines. After a rain much later, this suspicion was strengthened by the evidence in the cut running east and west.</wpa:narrative>
