  <wpa:narrative>Features 22 and 22B are fire basins superimposed but not on the same center. The eastern 2/3 of F# 22, the later basin are seen in upper right. F# 22B, the earlier basin, has rectangular corners, a slightly greater width, a somewhat shallower depth. The compact white ash bed is pictured here, as well as a trailer, which testifies to the order of their superimposition. See also photos 36, 37, 51. View from southwest. </wpa:narrative>
