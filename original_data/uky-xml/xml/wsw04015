  <wpa:narrative>Trowelled surface of area lying within wall outlines of structure II. The area, as freshly exposed by trowelling, is characterized at this level by the presence of charcoal, sometimes faint, sometimes occurring in some quantity as when charred roof or wall poles and cane are encountered. In the upper center is a rather heavy deposit of the material visible. Shallow trenches, right center, have been trowelled out in the removal of chunks of hard burned cane-marked clay. The actual level of habitation appears to have been a few inches lower than the surface here exposed, although at no time could a cleavage surface be discovered. The stake in the center of the photograph is 310L12. For detail of charcoal patch in upper center see photograph 3BT20. View from southeast. </wpa:narrative>
