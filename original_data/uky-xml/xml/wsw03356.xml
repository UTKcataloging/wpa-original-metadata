  <wpa:narrative>20- substitute profile cut in view of destruction of the 60' profile by rain storm. Section of profile embraced by the walls of house-structure indicates the house-floor with a posthole-pit penetrating it on the left, and on the right another that contained a posthole on the 58' line. At the left extreme of the profile is shown a cross-section of the longitudinally cut posthole trench of the south west foundation. The profile at the right extreme cuts the foundation at the corner and hence shows only a mold of a driven post. Immediately to the left of this driven posthole a small midden pit. View taken toward the North. From Notes: Weather -- clear and sunny. Adjustments -- f 32, 1/2 second. Subject -- 59' Profile. Features 3,5 and postholes showing. Only that part of 59' profile showing which is embraced by walls of Feature #3. </wpa:narrative>
