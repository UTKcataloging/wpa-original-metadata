  <wpa:narrative>An oval-shaped fireplace with a pit in one end of it. Also a small circular fireplace was nearby. An arrowpoint (FS #39) and a group of sherds (FS #40) were in the large fireplace. In the small fire-basin a group of sherds (FS #42) and a flint nodule (FS #43) were found.Length 5.40 ft. NE-SW.Width 3.60 ft. NW-SE.Deepest part of the pit extended into hardpan 1.30 ft. These small fireplaces seem to be found quite often near the large ones. Usually close enough that they seem to have some association with the larger.</wpa:narrative>
