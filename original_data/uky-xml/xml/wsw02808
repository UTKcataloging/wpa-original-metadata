  <wpa:narrative>Distant view of feature 19, antecedent gully. Presumably this drain entends to the left background, in the general neighborhood of the plank shown in this photo. An old drain, or gulley, resulting from natural erosion to the Ohio River; crossed by numerous rows of postholes; filled in with midden material, i.e. garbage, in aboriginal times. Only part was excavated. Much more of the drain lying to the east, but its southern terminus is shown. No more of it extends to the west, nor of the rows of postholes, as evidenced by plat "DD". The postholes are largely of uniform depth, and do not appear to have suffered from erosion. The midden material, obviously represents an artificial placement, rather than erosional detritus, since deliberately placed items, such as the bear skull (F.S. #226) were found in it. </wpa:narrative>
