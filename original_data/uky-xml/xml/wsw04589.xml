  <wpa:narrative> Photograph taken from the northwest of the mound during excavation operations. The men of the lower block of the mound are engaged in cleaning out the log molds of Tomb #15 (Feature #11) as exposed in the 120-125' section. Those men on the uppermost block of the 110-115' section are taking down that section by careful spading out of uniform levels one spade in depth. After each spade-length level has been removed the floor is carefully skinned with shovels to check for bark lines on other details which may have escaped attention during the spading. The string stretched just beneath the diggers on the 115' face is a guide to assist in maintaining level surfaces on the terraces under excavation.</wpa:narrative>
