  <wpa:narrative>Close-up of firepit, Feature 42, partially excavated, showing rock in place. Nearly round, concave-bottomed pit, filled nearly to top by medium sized (8-24 cubic inches) burned and broken red sandstone. Interspersed among the rocks were numerous flecks of charcoal, and ashy dirt. This pit evidently was the site of a fire, or many fires, but the earth was neither hardened nor discoloured. Offset to north is an obviously intrusive post hole.</wpa:narrative>
