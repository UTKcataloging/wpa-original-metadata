  <wpa:narrative>A shallow, irregular refuse pit lying a few feet to the west of Structure V. This photo shows about 2/3 of the entire pit area; the 1/3 which is not shown lay to the north, and at first was held in some question until its southern projection grew deeper. The topsoil above and surrounding the pit area was loamy and dark, - a fact which, with the contour of the surface nearby, suggests that at the time of occupation this was a marshy spot used haphazardly as a refuse dump. Several sizable fragments of pottery, a pottery trowel, and some bone bits are visible. View from north. </wpa:narrative>
