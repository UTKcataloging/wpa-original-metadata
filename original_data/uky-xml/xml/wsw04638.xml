  <wpa:narrative>Photograph taken from the north and from the top deck of the tower. Indicated are excavation operations on the north side of the mound. The men on the second block from the bottom are clearing the log molds of Tomb #15 in the 115-120' section. On the next block up two men are engaged getting elevations of log molds of Tomb #23 using stadia pole and framers level. To the right of them on the next block up is the tarpaulin on frame covering Tomb #16. On the upper terraces men are busy trowelling, brushing, shoveling and wheeling. Atop the mound is the small photographic table. Note the disfiguration of the surface contour of the mound caused by the open crater left after the digging of Feature #21.</wpa:narrative>
