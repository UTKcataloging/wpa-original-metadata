  <wpa:narrative>The profile, most of which has been cut away, was a part of R1. The part of R2 shown was that portion underlying the moat. The dark area at the top is the humus plus a stained zone underneath. A soft mucky clay is found directly under lowest part of moat. A much harder and deeper red clay is found on each side. There is a post mold at right which was dug with post hole diggers.</wpa:narrative>
