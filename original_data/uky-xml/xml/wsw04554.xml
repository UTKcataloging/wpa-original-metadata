  <wpa:narrative> Photograph taken from the south of the subject. Profiles incised to emphasize structural divisions. The small segment of profile on the foreground block is that of the 70' face. The main profile in the background is that of the 80' face extending from R-5 on the left to R-11 on the right. This small section of profile from the east end-zone was taken as a sample of many of the profiles recorded during the removal of the entire periphery of the mound through the course of the severe winter weather. The disfigurement of the surface contour or curvation noted in the upper left hand corner was cause by the large intrusive surface crater of which this is the eastern periphery. The uppermost layer in this profile is of finely mixed earth of bright color containing many particles of fired earth all suggesting to be of recent origin on the top surface of the mound ... source is the earth removed during the digging of the large intrusions on the east side of the mound and thrown down the slope. Beneath this layer is one of homogeneous yellow-grey earth whose top surface originally comprised the top of the mound before the intrusive diggings. The third layer from the tops is generally indistinct mottled and mixed yellow and grey earth with indistinct and scattered loading appearing to the left which dips also to the left comprising the collapsed earth roof of Tomb #10 (Feature #29) ... this tomb indicated in this profile by the lines in the dip at the bottom of this layer which had bark and fired clay on them. </wpa:narrative>
