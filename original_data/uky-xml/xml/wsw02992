  <wpa:narrative>Photo of ash pit partially excavated with intrusive slab lined pit in one corner. This may be central fire basin for house "M-1". Old floor remnants in right background between end of pit and post holes in background. Shallow, concave pit, walls fairly steep near top, curve to concave bottom. Bottom two inches of fill pure ash, remainder mixed ash and dirt, in clods. In one end an intrusive pit, lined with rock, filled soft dark dirt. Suggestion is that this is part of house "M", and that ash pit is antecedent. Ash pit is not a fire basin, as there is no discolouration of soil. Purpose?</wpa:narrative>
