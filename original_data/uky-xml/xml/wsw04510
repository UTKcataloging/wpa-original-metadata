  <wpa:narrative>Viewed from the south is the 45' Profile. Indicated is the mound fill in direct contact in an irregular line with the undisturbed yellow clay suggesting removal of the OH by soraphing or digging... this probably used as a source of earth for mound construction. In the center is a truncated dome of indistinctly loaded and mixed earth of uncertain structural significance. On either slope of this truncated dome is a skirt of mottled yellow and grey clay. Overlying the whole is a band of homogeneous, highly leached, yellow-grey silty clay. The upper line of the far right divides this latter from a marginal skirt of accumulated surface washed material from the upper part of the mound. This was also present on the west slope of the mound but is not readily discernible in this photograph because of shadow cast by apple tree.</wpa:narrative>
