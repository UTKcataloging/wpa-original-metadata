  <wpa:narrative>A north-south cross-section of fire basin, F#48, which measured 3.4' in length, 2.6' in width, .4' in depth. The fill was hard packed white ash showing a high degree of burning, which contained a few sherds, some fragments of burned bone, but no charcoal. The incised line marks the bottom of the burned level below the basin. In the center a radial pier of ash fill has been left standing. View from west. </wpa:narrative>
