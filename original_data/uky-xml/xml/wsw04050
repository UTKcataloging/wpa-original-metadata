  <wpa:narrative>Postmold pattern of Structure 7, with molds halved and excavated. The structure is almost exactly 20 feet square and sits almost exactly on the compass. Ten foot stakes have been left standing on pillars to indicate dimensions and relative depths of features associated with the outline. In the center of the outline is the fire basin, half of which has been left standing. The top of the fire basin is approximately the level of the floor of the structure. In the lower right are seen two parallel wall lines which have the appearance of a narrow doorway. The fact that there is no postmold at the regular interval in the wall line between the inner ends of the "wall" lines adds strength to the idea. It is within the outline that Structure 8 was later discovered. View from southwest. </wpa:narrative>
