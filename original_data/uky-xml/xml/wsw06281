  <wpa:narrative>This cut was worked in very dry weather. A rain fell before the cut was refilled. A retake was made which shows the wall much more clearly. Note the moat which is in the probably undisturbed area. The humus and disturbed earth in moat is deeper than originally thought. The middle of the moat seems to have been disturbed to less depth than that on each side. This is also indicated in other cuts across moat.</wpa:narrative>
