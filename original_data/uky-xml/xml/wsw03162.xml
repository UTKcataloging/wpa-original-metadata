  <wpa:narrative>Photographed from the southwest is seen the earth ring in the profile and its extension of in situ rock slabs which are included in it. Note that the attitude of the rock slabs conforms to their position in the earth ring that is tilted inwardly toward the center of the ring or outwardly. Very faint loads that tilt inwardly are to be seen in the central cavity fill.</wpa:narrative>
