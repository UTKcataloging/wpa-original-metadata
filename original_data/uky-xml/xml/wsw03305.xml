  <wpa:narrative>Features in Primary Mound top. F#37 is a small (1.5' in diameter), shallow (.3' in depth), unevenly, and poorly burned fire basin with gray clay fill. F#38 is not a complete fire basin, but rather a burned circular ridge. It is difficult to explain the deep burning on the south side of the pit, as found in vertical section, and the almost complete lack of burning on the north side. Feature #37 is seen at the left. View from north. </wpa:narrative>
