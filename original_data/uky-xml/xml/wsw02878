  <wpa:narrative>Close-up of southwestern end of compound pit. Feature 57, showing lump of pottery clay, F.S. 595, in situ. Group of pits, more or less originating from a single one giving the impression of contemporaneity if not in origin, at least in final use. Impossible to describe well. The individual pits are flat bottomed, with reasonably vertical walls, the tops of which hold at about the elevations listed. The lump of pottery clay appears to have been prepared for use, shell tempering added, and then carefully placed in the bottom of the pit where found.</wpa:narrative>
