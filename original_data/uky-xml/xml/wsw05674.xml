  <wpa:narrative>This shows a hard area crossing test trench. The two squares north were cut down to the hard surface but not through it. A great deal of it was cut through in test trench. It began under the Stake in right hand corner and ran a little over 15 feet west. The hard material crossed trench running a little east and west of north and south. At extreme left is a post set at some recent date. </wpa:narrative>
