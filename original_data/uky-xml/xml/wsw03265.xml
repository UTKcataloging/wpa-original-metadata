  <wpa:narrative>Feature 11, an irregular bank of burned clay, perhaps part of a fire basin; probably partly destroyed by the growth of a gum tree over it. It lies within an accumulation of wall lines and post-molds which have been recorded as Feature 10. Feature 10, however, is probably part of Feature 9. View from northwest.
