  <wpa:narrative>The humus was indefinite on the west side of mount slope; on the east side it was deep and definite. A fill is shown from 25L1 - 25L2. As a matter of fact, all above the line near the floor is fill. The holes in the foreground are post molds. The plank stakes are on the zero line. The stump of a sourwood which is on top of little mound can be seen. The roots of this tree it was found helped destroy the made walls of the central pit.</wpa:narrative>
