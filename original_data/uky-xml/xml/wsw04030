  <wpa:narrative>A bed of rocks, red and black as if from burning, about 6 feet wide. The absence of ash or burned dirt suggests that it is not a firehearth; furthermore, there is only a single thickness of rock present. Four feet to the east, not shown in this photograph, is a much smaller concentration of rock, similar in appearance, but smaller in size and, in places, two to three thicknesses deep. Neither does this second rock bed have the earmarks of a firehearth; both have, rather, the appearance of discarded stones used in fire-making activities. There are no fire basins in the immediate vicinity. View from north. </wpa:narrative>
