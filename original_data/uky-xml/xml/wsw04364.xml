  <wpa:narrative>These subsurface sand piles with accompanying holes lying next to them were for some time a vexations problem when viewed from an archaeological standpoint. It was later decided that, since the sand in the sand pile showed no human disturbance, and was even shot through with heavy seepage bands that these phenomena must be geological, possibly resulting from the action of high river water in a low sand field.
