  <wpa:narrative>Photograph taken from the southwest, atop the tower, and 75' from the subject. Indicated is the circular house structure (Feature #26) with a circular trench cut around it, and with the postholes of the center circle bisected longitudinally and their contents removed. Mote that these postholes slope inwardly proceeding down. Further that each of the large holes in this outer circle contained two posts whose tips retain their individual molds at the bottoms where they were driven into the solid undisturbed earth, or where the earth tamped in around them retained their original form. In the center is the circle of six vertical postholes left by the columns which supported the roof. Sprinkled in and around them are small holes left by driven stakes (aborignal) or roots. The two vertical holes just inside the outer ring on the right are perhaps related to a doorway or some other means of exit.</wpa:narrative>
