  <wpa:narrative>Wall outline of Structure 6 as seen from 10' tower. Lying almost exactly on the compass, it is close to 17' wide (E-W), and 22' long. The walls are of the type which do not show postmolds in horizontal face, although certain postmolds are easily visible at the corners. A pair of entry walls, such as the feature found in structure 7, are seen at right. Their final outline, however, was not that exactly as indicated in the picture. Two fire basins are seen in the center, one of them halved. They belong to two different periods of occupation of this structure. The nearer, and smaller, of the two is associated with the smaller structure. The principal habitational level of the structure is represented by the height of the fire basin rims. This depth can be compared with the ground level, preserved on pillar tops. View from south. </wpa:narrative>
