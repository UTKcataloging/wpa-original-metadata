  <wpa:narrative>This cache occurred at a depth of 1.5' below surface, in the floor of Structure 10, at a point about 3' from the west wall and 4 1/2' from the south wall, although no floor level as such can be determined exactly. Some sherds covered the shell, much of which does not seem to be mussel. Several of the chunks are apparently blanks from which it was intended to produce beads. Five beads, or bead sections, were found among them. One of these sections is seen to the right; it was disturbed in uncovering the cache. Its greatest width is 0.35', depth 0.25'. View from east. </wpa:narrative>
