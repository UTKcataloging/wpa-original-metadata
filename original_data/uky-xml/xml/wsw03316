  <wpa:narrative>Feature 47, fire basin on the surface of the Sub-Primary mound. Although shallow, (.2') it shows a very great degree of burning. It lacks a clearly defined shoulder: within its greater dimensions of 5.0' in length, 4.2' in width, it has a deeper central area with a yellow brick-like bottom measuring 2.4' by 2.1', which was covered by a very compact ash bed. In the ash was F.S. 10, a zoomorphic decoration of pottery. View from west. </wpa:narrative>
