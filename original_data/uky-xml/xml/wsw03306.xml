  <wpa:narrative>Feature 20, puddled clay fire basin on west slope of primary mound. It is circular, 2.2' in diameter, and averages .35' in interior depth. It had the usual clay fill, but lacked the cake of ash deposit on the bottom. Because of its position on the mound slope, its western border may be partly eroded. View from south. </wpa:narrative>
