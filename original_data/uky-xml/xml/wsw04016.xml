In the center foreground are several pieces of charred cane overlying a charred pole. At the left lower is a vertical section of roof support pole .5' in diameter, .3' in height, preserved as Field Specimen #6 (dendrochronological). Top center is a sizeable section of very crumbly but rather thick pottery. View from the west. </wpa:narrative>
