  <wpa:narrative>This section of profile is that embraced within the walls of the house-structure after the latter was isolated en bloc. At the left side is seen a cross-section of the longitudinal section of the southwest foundation trench in which were set the posts belonging to that wall. Similarly on the right side of the bloc is that of the northwest foundation trench. The view is taken toward the North. The floor is not apparent in this photograph. </wpa:narrative>
