  <wpa:narrative>A large refuse pit lying just west of the base of the mound BT2. It contained two large sacks of debris, chiefly pottery. The pit probably dated from the time of primary mound occupation, or before it, for it could not be followed up to the present ground level, and dirt of the secondary mound period covered it. The parallel incised lines in the fore part of the photograph mark the course of the riverside palisade line, Feature #65. View from northeastward. </wpa:narrative>
