  <wpa:narrative> Photograph taken from the southeast of subject with important structural divisions in profile segments incised for emphasis. The wall on right hand side of the picture is a portion of the 80' profile, and that on the left is a small portion of profile on the R-6 line. The vertical incised line in the 80' profile in the upper left hand corner of the photograph defines the edge of the intrusive pit ... Feature #24. The incised line in the lower corner, center, demarks the bark-covered floor of Tomb #9 (Feature #34). On the right-hand extremity of this line note the small hole which was one of the supporting rafter mold which held the earth roof over this tomb. Note the filled log mold in the corner. The incised lines in the center corner that define the top of the earth roof over Tomb #9 also constitute the floor of the Tomb #10 which was fired and covered with bark also. Note that the earth fill of the collapsed roof of this tomb as well as that over Tomb #9 are mottled and with only very indistinct scattered loading to indicate the collapse involved in each.</wpa:narrative>
