  <wpa:narrative>Feature # 3, viewed from west. This feature consisted of a series of rocks of various sizes ranging to 2 by 2 ft. which showed some accordancy of placement suggesting that they might have been on the edge of a pit. It is probable that this area was disturbed by the excavations of Fischer in 1870.</wpa:narrative>
