  <wpa:narrative>Feature # 5, MU4b, which was a broken pot lying partly below the mound and partly in the mound fill. It apparently had been placed in the mound whole but has been spread laterally by earth pressure. Several flint chips and one point were associated with it and may have been deliberately placed in the mound along with the pot.</wpa:narrative>
