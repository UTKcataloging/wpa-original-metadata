  <wpa:narrative>Feature No. 7 is a refuse pit containing some quantity of mussell shell. The outline of the pit became apparent at 1.1' below stake 170 R 4. The depth of the shell lens was close to one foot. One ten pound sack of shell, bone fragments, and flint was saved, without assignment of a field specimen number. This was the only good refuse pit on BT WL. View from north.</wpa:narrative>
