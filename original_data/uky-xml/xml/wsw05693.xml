  <wpa:narrative>The stake by the number is 85 R 4. Facing the SE. Note the clean yellow clay in all profiles. It was the only place in which muck was not encountered while cutting across the moat. There is no stain in the clay below the humus. The deep cuts on each side of the picture show where the muck began. The floor of cut in those deep portions ran downward roughly with the muck. The holes in the floor were root molds worked out in an effort to locate post molds.</wpa:narrative>
