  <wpa:narrative>The hard area is the north (made) wall of the central pit. The rest of the wall was cut away. The central pit is in the area of the root that shows at right. Some of the wall at left was also cut away but shows in bottom of profile. The top zone is the usual humus from fill soil. The next soil zone is fill. The zone just above the wall was rather hard though definitely disturbed. It may have been the part of the wall that has weakened due to natural causes.</wpa:narrative>
