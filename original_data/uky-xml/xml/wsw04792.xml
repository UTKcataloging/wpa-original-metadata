  <wpa:narrative>Photograph taken from the north and above the subjects. Indicated is the circular pattern of postholes in completed horizontal exposure. The layer of ashes and bones from the floor have been removed. Each of the incised rings in the circle contains two postholes which will be come apparent in the vertical sectioning of the foundation. Some of these postholes have remained open after the rotting or burning out of the wood. The six open postholes of the central small ring are left by the vertical columns which supported the roof. The many small holes indicated were left by strokes driven into the floor or by roots ... vertical sectioning determines which later. Note the two holes just inside the circle and on the east side ... these proved to be vertical, distinguishing them from the postholes of the wall which slant inwardly and down, and may be related to a doorway or some other means of exit. Otherwise there seems to be no gap in the main circle suggesting a doorway.</wpa:narrative>
