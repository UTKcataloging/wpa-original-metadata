  <wpa:narrative>Feature 13, the upper or later basin, is a very well burned pit, subconical in shape, rather than rounding, and 3.0' in diameter, .55' deep, sunk in the surface of the primary mound. Further excavation disclosed the presence of an earlier and only slightly deeper basin, its eastern side rather square cornered, its other half lost on the later basin. In the photo one-half of F#13 is seen at left. The ash-bed covering the bottom of 13B is at upper right center. A trailer has been left in excavating the earlier basin in order to check stratification. View from southwestward. </wpa:narrative>
