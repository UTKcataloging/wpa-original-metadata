  <wpa:narrative>Holes in floor were probably the result of roots. They are in very hard clay. The top zone is humus. The next zone is a clay fill by Mr. Cooper, the owner. There is another zone of humus underlying the clay fill. The zone underlying the humus is of the same material as the humus but seems less disturbed. There was much grey sand washed from the outer ring southward. The big zone just above the floor is the blue-red clay muck flanked on higher level by a much redder harder clay.</wpa:narrative>
