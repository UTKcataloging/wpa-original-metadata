  <wpa:narrative>This view was taken from the top of a strawstack during the excavation of "alleged" MCL 8. This site is so identified in the U of K archaeologicial survey manual but upon investigation proved to be non-existent, consequently the number was used for another site that is located on the I.G. Reynerson farm nearby. Indicated on the right of the photograph is one of the exploratory trenches. This photograph is of some value in indicating the location of the background, to the left of the houses, and with a row of eight cedar trees in the background. </wpa:narrative>
