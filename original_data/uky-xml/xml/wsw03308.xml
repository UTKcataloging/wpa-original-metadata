  <wpa:narrative>Feature 44, fire pit nearly full of ash and refuse located in Sub-Primary Mound top. It is quite similar to Feature 42, except that it is larger -3.3' in greater diameter. It is identified as a fire basin because of the burned sides and bottom. But on the other hand the burning is comparatively thin and the fill has the character of refuse pit fill. And, again, the outer burned rim or shoulder is missing, which, of course, might have been trimmed off in preparing the surface for the building of the Primary mound. The debris included a great deal of wood ash, charcoal, and brownish wood dust. There was a great deal of pottery, burned bone, and the like. Beneath the burned layer on the bottom was a deposit of debris fill which did not show evidence of burning. This, then, may be merely a refuse pit in which rubbish was burned. View from north. </wpa:narrative>
