  <wpa:narrative> Photograph taken from the south of incised profiles. The small foreground face is a segment of the 7-' Profile; this between Stakes R-5 and R-7. The bottom line divided the mound fill from the undisturbed yellow clay beneath. The top of the second layer of finely mixed earth rises to the left to form the east well of Tomb #27 (Feature #16), hidden behind the foreground block. The bright yellow and brown loaded layer comprises the roof of this tomb. The background profile extends from Stake R-4 on the left to R-11 on the right. This right hand end of the profile (east side of the mound) are bands of carious colored earth of obscure structural significance best ascertained by referring to the profile drawings. Note that the mound fill meets the yellow clay in a sharp line without any intervening Old Humus band. The top two layers of earth demarked are the talus thrown and washed from the pot-hole (Feature #21). The flattening in the mound surface noted in the upper left hand corner is also due to this disfiguration. </wpa:narrative>
