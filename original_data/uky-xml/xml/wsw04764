  <wpa:narrative>Photograph taken from the south of the subjects. Is of a general progress nature. Indicated on the foreground block of the 70-75' section is a small portion of the 70' profile. To the left of this section banked earth covers a portion of the house structure (Feature #26) exposed therein. The portion of the 70-75' section that is highest supports Tomb #49 (Feature #42) insofar as it lies in that section. The second profile back is the 75' face. The brightly loaded dome of earth on the left comprises the west wall of Tomb #49. The uppermost incised line on this face bore traces indicating that advantage had been taken of the cavity created by the collapse of the earth roof of Tomb #49 which afforded a ready made tomb with walls etc. The 75' Profile cut a vertical section through this tomb (#50 - Feature #40) which is exposed, insofar as it remains, in the 75-80' section. Tomb #50 showed no indications of the presence of a burial in the little that remained of it. See also Photo 265BE3. The low block of earth on the extreme right supports the exposed Tomb #46. </wpa:narrative>
