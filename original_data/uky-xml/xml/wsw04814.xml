  <wpa:narrative>Photograph taken from the north of the subject. Indicated is a vertical profile through the postholes of the inner circle of the circular house structure (Feature #26). These holes appeared to have been dug deeper than necessary and then to have been refilled to within about 0.6' of the top of the block before the columns were set. Proof of this is found in the fact that these holes cleaned out very readily down to a depth of 0.6' and to this depth the walls of the holes were readily fired. Also the bottom of the hole was fired at this depth. The remainder of the hole was hard packed with mixed earth and ashes and the walls showed no firing. Not all the holes bore this evidence, but those which are not completely cleaned out did so. </wpa:narrative>
