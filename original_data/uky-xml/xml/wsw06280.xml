  <wpa:narrative>The line in the profile was placed in when the soil was dry. After the rain it seemed to have dropped to the floor of the end sq. Note the dry hard appearance of the profile below the line in the second sq. This condition was noted in other cuts across the outer walls of this site as sell as in the wall of MM30. It must have been prepared and covered over with a looser layer, or the looser layer was caused by weather.</wpa:narrative>
