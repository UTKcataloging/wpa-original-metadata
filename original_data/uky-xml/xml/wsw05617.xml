  <wpa:narrative>View from the east and above the subject. Indicated is the house after all ash and fired clay had been stripped from it, and it had been cut down to the level of the yellow clay. All intruding post and stake holes are now evident. The complete circle is clear and is emphasized by each hole having some of the earth removed from it. Four central column post holes are evident, each which has a small hole inset from it which is considered to have supported some sort of screen around the fire. Where tomb 5 lay, four large holes are evident (incised) immediately opposite the doorway and at the back wall of the house. These are considered to have supported some sort of elevated platform or dais. Note that there are two concentric arcs of small paired stake holes diverging on each side of the house from the dais. These are considered to have supported bleachers or seats.</wpa:narrative>
