  <wpa:narrative>The humus was very definite and is shown by the first line from top. The second line is moat also shows a humus zone but it had not been disturbed by plow. Note the great number of roots under stakes 125 and 130. The roots confused the picture enough that there is some doubt as to depth of the aboriginal disturbances. There is a possibility that these roots were not below aboriginal disturbances. This suspension was strengthened by a later cut west along the 95L line. On the rim there was only the humus and the fill material underneath the humus. At the extreme right the humus was divided by the plow into two distinct parts. </wpa:narrative>
