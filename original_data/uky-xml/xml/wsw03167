  <wpa:narrative>Subjects photographed from the south and from a slightly elevated position. Indicated is the relationship between the rock slabs and the ring (Feature 4) with the truncated domes in the 30 foot profile and the central subfloor pit (Feature 2) as it appears in the 30 foot profile. Note how the very indistinct loads of the central ring cavity tilt into the fill of the pit below the mound floor level. Note the band of hardpan clay included in the right hand truncated dome of the earth ring wall. In the background is that portion of the rock ring exposed to the north of the 35 foot profile.</wpa:narrative>
