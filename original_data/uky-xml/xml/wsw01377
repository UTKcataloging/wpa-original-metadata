In the lower right-hand corner of the photograph and between the corner of the walls is the outline of the burial pit of Burial 465 (this line should have just contacted the tips of both walls as indicated in photograph 242 instead of missing that of the north wall). Note that southwest corner has been cut away. Feature #61.</wpa:narrative>
