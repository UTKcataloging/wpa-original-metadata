  <wpa:narrative>At the top of the picture a pair of parallel east-west wall outlines are seen, ending in a dark circular patch for purposes of notetaking called a "refuse pit" because of its rather regular and definite outline, and in spite of flint, pottery, or other refuse material being totally absent as is often the case in other similar 'pits' on this site. There are several occurrences present of multiple and somewhat confused wall outlines, of which this is a good example. These two sets of paired wall outlines, however, represent parts of the north and west walls of Structure III. View from south. </wpa:narrative>
