  <wpa:narrative>70 foot profile between 70L6 and 70L8 stakes and also the juncture of this profile with the L8 profile between the 70L8 and 65L8 stakes. The right half of this photo is a continuation of the profile shown in photo 26Oh1. This view shows the interlarded lenses of shell and river deposit overlain with a washed stratum which has been eroded and plowed from the top of the mound. The steep slope shown here is apparently an old stew bank on the edge of which heap once stood and which has since been filled in by floods.</wpa:narrative>
