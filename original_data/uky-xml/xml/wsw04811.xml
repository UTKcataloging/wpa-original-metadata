  <wpa:narrative>Photograph taken from the southeast of the subject. Indicated is a man holding a post snugly fitted into a better preserved posthole (no.3) in the northeast quarter of the circular house pattern (outer circle) to demonstrate the angle the walls of this aboriginal house must have assumed. The post, plumb bob string and stadia pole form a right triangle whose hypotenuse is four feet long (from the top of the block to the juncture with string) whose base is 1.2' long, and whose angle formed by the base and the hypotenuse is 67.5 degrees. This indicates that the wall (at least this post) diverged outwardly 22.5 degrees from the vertical. This post is representative of others, although it was one of the best preserved of the lot.</wpa:narrative>
