  <wpa:narrative>Exposed at a depth of 1' to 1.2' below surface is the 'floor' area of Structure IV, covered with charred sections of poles and cane, which once were part of walls or roof; fragment of highly polished celt (F.S. 42), right center; mass of pottery clay (F.S. 40) left margin, pottery fragments, and whetstones, and other artifacts are visible. The 'floor' of the structure is not a smooth level surface nor even a cleavage plane, but the vertical section of deposit several inches in thickness richest in material. View from west. Oddly these structures have no hard-beaten floors which can be cleared at a definite plane of the post-occupational debris which has fallen in on them.
