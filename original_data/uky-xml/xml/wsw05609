  <wpa:narrative>Photograph taken from the east and from the tower. Indicated is the precedent house structure beneath the mound in its first stage of complete exposure. The circle of paired holes have been incised for clarity. The four offset holes on the extreme left comprise an entry way. Just within the wall or circle on the extreme right can be seen the molds of the framework logs around burial 11 in tomb 5. Note the slight elevation in the center. This dome is pure wood ashes and was left by the occupants on this fireplace location. Two fragmentary charred timbers lie to the left of this. The large hole at the end of the stadial rod is one of the open holes where a column rested supporting the roof. The roughened area running back under the mound is a heavily fired floor level where the house fell burning.</wpa:narrative>
