  <wpa:narrative>The right hand vertical face is on the 110 line from R 0-12. The photo demonstrates two things; 1) The depth to which color in the surface soil extends, and 2) the fact that digging conditions were far from ideal in March, for the water in the picture has seeped steadily up through the floor of the cut. View from the west. Photo 10 is a close-up of the vertical wall seen in far center. </wpa:narrative>
