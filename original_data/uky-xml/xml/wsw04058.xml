  <wpa:narrative>F.S. 139. Pottery Rattle or Ornament. In Structure 11. Pottery rattle containing clay pellets, perhaps an ornament on the side of a bowl, parts of which were later found immediately below. The cap or cover of the small bowl, which is less than two inches in diameter, was accidentally removed by shovel, had been baked and sealed on so that the whole object was quite round in outward appearance. Whether the object was actually an ornament fixed to the rim of a vessel may be determined when the facilities of the laboratory are available. View from the south. </wpa:narrative>
