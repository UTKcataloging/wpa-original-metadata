  <wpa:narrative>Close-up of two irregular pits, Feature 29 on left, 30 on right. Although these look like root-holes, resulting from overturned stumps, evidence is that they were deliberately dug in this shape. Feature 29: Irregular pit, sloping from edges to interior straight-walled pit, with several grooves and holes between this edge and the external boundaries. Filled with dark brown soil. Feature 30: Pit of extremely irregular outline, sloping to central, straight sided hole. Filled with dark brownish dirt. Significance of either pit not apparent.</wpa:narrative>
