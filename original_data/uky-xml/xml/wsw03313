  <wpa:narrative>Feature 4, a large refuse area about 9.0' long, a deposit of brownish debris, containing sherds, burned dirt, bone, charcoal, and the like. Near its north end (at right, in picture) was a bed of clear, white ash, such as is usually found in fire basins. This part of the feature is not outlined in the photo. The feature lay on the old humus, and, hence, at this point, is shown to date from the period of occupation of the Sub-Primary mound. It is quite similar in character to F #52. View from east. </wpa:narrative>
