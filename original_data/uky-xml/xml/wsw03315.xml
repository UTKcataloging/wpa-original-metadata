  <wpa:narrative>Feature 46 is a series of four nested and overlapping fire basins. Of the four units, two only are visible at this stage of excavation. They are seen at the left; the trailer runs through unit III, unit IV is the white spot just to the right below it. The other two units have not yet been exposed. The fire basin at the right has, for clearness, been handled alone; it is Feature 55. The lack of color in the photograph obscures the outlines and their relationship, which, on the ground, are clear. View from east. </wpa:narrative>
