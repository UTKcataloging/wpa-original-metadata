  <wpa:narrative>This photograph was taken from the northeast of the ninety foot profile, between the R-11 and the R-15 lines. This is at the east end of the site where it falls away to a small slough cutting into the bank from the Green River. The trees in the background define the edge of the slough. Illustrated is a shell lens dipping off toward the old slough bank with an extended fore-shape of dark midden-soil. Overlying the shell and midden fore-slope is a deposit of archeaologically sterile river silt which tapers off to the right, ending where the shell lens approaches the surface on higher ground.</wpa:narrative>
