  <wpa:narrative>View of profile of firepit. Feature No. 4. Profile formed by L10 line of stakes. This fire pit was a rectangular basin with walls of fired clay. It had apparently been dug or otherwise prepared. It also was probably dug from the present mound surface or near there. It had no apparent connection with either of the post mold patterns (F# 13 &amp; 17) as it was about one foot above them.</wpa:narrative>
