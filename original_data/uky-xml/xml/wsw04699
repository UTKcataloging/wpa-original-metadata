  <wpa:narrative>Photograph taken from the south side of the mound and from the top of the photographic tower. At this point in excavation much has been removed from the south side of the mound, north, and both sides as can be seen. The men atop the mound are engaged in removing the last five foot cut of the original mound surface ... rope bannisters protect them from misstep. Another man on one of the lower blocks is taking an elevation reading. Other men are wheeling wheelbarrows.</wpa:narrative>
