  <wpa:narrative>This is a photograph of a Mastadon lower mandible and vertebrae uncovered in the deep-cut strem bed of a tributary of Buck Creek on the farm of Homer Taylor seven miles north of Calhoun. In was uncovered by workmen digging a hole for a spring tile. Lying before the snout and of the jaw was about a foot of tusk. The preservation of the bone was due to its constant and complete immersion in water - this was walled off for the photograph. The section of verebrae lies across and behind the articulating surfaces of the jaw. The view is taken from the bank above the creek. This fragment lay nine feet below the present surface and due to its incomplete and scattered character undoubtedly washed into its present location. It was impossible to secure this specimine for museum purposes.</wpa:narrative>
