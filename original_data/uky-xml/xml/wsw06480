  <wpa:narrative>Note at extreme left field made equipment that holds and shades drawing board. Under the stake at extreme right is a line designating humus. The line near the floor is to show the bottom of the fill which went to make up the inside of the north wall. The second line down that runs through the moatlike depression marks bottom of humus. The line above in the same section shows bottom of plowed soil. The frequency of roots and the looseness of soil indicates that depression may have been dug a bit deeper and part of the soil replaced. The soil in central area in places seemed to have been disturbed below plow. This possibly disturbed soil was very clean. It suggested that ther may have been a leveling process by filling in with outside material or possibly the high areas were cut down and filled into low spots.</wpa:narrative>
