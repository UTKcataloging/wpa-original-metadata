  <wpa:narrative>At this point a line has been drawn, somewhat arbitrarily, to mark the limit of BT20 and the beginning of BT2. Actually the profile is that of BT2, large earth mound, for the reason that in it is seen a clay level peculiar to the mound. In the photograph, four levels are seen set off by three lines drawn in the profile: 1) topsoil, 2) sandy layer with some charcoal, 3) area containing irregular patches of mottled gray clay, 4) bottom level in which are seepage lines. View from North. Photo 77 is a continuation of this profile in the four squares adjoining to the west. See also photos 78, 79. </wpa:narrative>
