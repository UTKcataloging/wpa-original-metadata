  <wpa:narrative> Photograph taken from the south of the subject with profiles freshly trowelled and incised for emphasis. The mound appears in the same stage of progress as it was when work was stopped on it late in December of 1939. These faces were exposed to extremely severe subzero winter weather for three months with only superficial damage due to exfoliation ... the faces of course have been freshened. The end zones to right and left of the mound were removed during the winter leaving an irregularly shaped "sugar loaf" mound.</wpa:narrative>
