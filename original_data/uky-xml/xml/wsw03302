  <wpa:narrative>Primary mound top. The strongly marked, deep postmold line, which is the chief feature of the primary mound, runs across the center. The north slope of the mound has been removed in the exposure of the postmold line. The pillars in the foreground mark the original height of the mound slope at these points. Fire basins on the mound top are seen in the back ground. See also photos 52, 53. View from north. Green River at back. </wpa:narrative>
