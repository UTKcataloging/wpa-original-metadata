  <wpa:narrative> Subject photographed from the south with the 65' face incised to emphasize structural divisions. The foreground block supports the partially exposed Tomb #1 (Feature #3) against the background of the 65' profile. Only the northern corner of this tomb remains unexposed which is indicated by the remaining portion of the collapsed earth roof in profile ... note the dipping and fractured loading. Note the bright horizontally loaded earth of the walls on either side of the remaining portion of the filled tomb chamber. On the inner shoulder of the right-hand wall note the incised dark circle that was one of the poles supporting the earthen roof over the tomb cavity. Beneath the right hand portion of Tomb #1 is noted the band of finely mixed earth comprising the extended eastern edge of the primary Tomb #4, which is seen in part to the left of Tomb #1 and against which the latter abbutted. The band of fine mixed earth above noted extends beneath Tomb #1's floor. On top the collapsed roof of Tomb #1 is indicated the bark lines of Tomb #3 ... band of mixed earth with incised circle at either end suggesting possible leg molds. Above the flue-like projection from the 65' face is the charred timbers of Feature #2. The segment of background profile is of the 75' face and is only tentatively incised.</wpa:narrative>
