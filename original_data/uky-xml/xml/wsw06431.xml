  <wpa:narrative>This map does not fit the present sites, except in a general sort of way. By turning map counter clockwise 90° , that is present north becomes west, a bit of sense comes into drawing. "A", "B", and Fort Meeting house are in relatively the correct positions. The intionees to "A" and "B" face north; "A" as a matter of fact seems to open to the East; "B" must have opened to the southeast. "C" should be just a bit north of east, but the map shows it due north. "D" was not located though considereble time was spent hunting for it. "E" was possibly located but if so again the map is in error; a mound, possibly "E", is located 36° south of east from a point just south of the base of "C". The old roads are no longer in positions shown. By turning map 90°, Brush Creek assumes relatively the proper place. But the stream near the meeting house is flowing in the wrong direction; also the stream seems much smaller than shown on the map. </wpa:narrative>
