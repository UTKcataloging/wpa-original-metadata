  <wpa:narrative>Whether the outline on the accompanying diagram is the correct one for the secondary structure depends on which molds are given to the primary structure. If the primary structure is the large one as given on that sheet, all that can safely be said to belong to the secondary structure is the line of molds just south of the clay platform or sheet Feature 41. If the primary structure is given by the smaller figures on that feature sheet, this would allow a complete secondary structure, i.e., the one given on the accompanying diagram.</wpa:narrative>
