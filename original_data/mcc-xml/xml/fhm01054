  <wpa:narrative>This burial lay in the mound about 2.5' above the old land surface. It lays beneath the clay band which I had tentatively assigned as the major delay in the construction of the entire mound (see mound construction discussion). All that remained was an impression of the mandible (photo 39HY10) and the very badly decomposed tibiae. Nothing could be immediately associated with the burial, but F.S. 33 occurred very near the burial (see 6 profile). Both parts, mandible and legs were independently found in vertical cutting and their association is only by deduction from identical datum depths and longitudinal proximity.</wpa:narrative>
