  <wpa:narrative>The remnants indicate a rectangular altar had been modelled to a height of 0.3' above the the floor L2 of Feature 64. There are two circular pits in the middle of the east edge of the feature which contains a large stream boulder. Large chunks ostensibly from the destroyed part of the feature were previously encountered scattered through the mound fill as far as 10 feet from the feature. No ash or charcoal was found in the large pit. The smaller contained some ash.</wpa:narrative>
