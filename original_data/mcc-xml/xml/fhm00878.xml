  <wpa:narrative>Two large upright slabs formed the sides. Two large slabs lay over the top but had apparently shifted to the north - cracking and breaking one. There were no slabs at the end. There was no slab bottom in the grave. About half the depth of the slab side wall had apparently been filled and the skeleton laid on this. The soil under the cover and over and around the skeleton was packed hard and not loose and porous.</wpa:narrative>
