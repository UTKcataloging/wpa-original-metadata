  <wpa:narrative>The northeast portion of both of these clay fire bowls was missing. This portion of the larger (bottom) bowls was probably destroyed in building the top (smaller) bowl. Both of these bowls were made of hard burned clay. From this center position it seems probable that these bowls were associated with the fifth structure (Feature #26). The measurements given above are for the smaller bowl, those of the larger (bottom) bowl are: Maximum length = 16". Maximum width = 10.5". The orientation was the same as the smaller fire bowl.</wpa:narrative>
