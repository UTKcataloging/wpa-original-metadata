  <wpa:narrative>Post molds show about 0.5' below the level at which the pit was first outlined. The posts were not set in trenches. Two stones lay within the post mold pattern - probably on the original floor of the structure. No such floor surface could be determined. Large support posts show in the NW and NE corner and along the East and West sides. The post molds come in at about 1.5' below the present surface - the pit showed at an average of 0.8' below the surface. Presence of midden material on top of and less in pit suggest that the place was used as a garbage dump after house was abandoned.</wpa:narrative>
