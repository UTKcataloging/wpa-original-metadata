  <wpa:narrative>Lies very close to the pit in which lies burial 4HA1, but independent of it, as far as the evidence indicates. Both pits are traceable to the base of the humus zone. Some of the stones are cracked, but probably not from firing. No evidence of fire here. The soil within the pit is only slightly discolored by humus mixture, and no cultural material is found in it. </wpa:narrative>
