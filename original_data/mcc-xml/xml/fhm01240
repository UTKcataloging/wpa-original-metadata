  <wpa:narrative>This structure is nearly square, delineated by a post mold pattern. No wall mold is apparent although the nature of the soil would make one very difficult to see. In excavating this structure, a profile was left through the center of the earth lying above the floor. This was composed of wattle work, flecks of red clay, charcoal and humic earth evenly spread across the entire structure so that it is probable that the entire structure was covered with a layer of earth. The post mold pattern has open corners and no corner post. Internally are a considerable number of misc. post molds that associate either with this structure or Feature 36. This structure was directly under Feature 36 structure, being so close that the two structures had to be worked out simultaneously. The fire basin was directly under Feat. 36 basin and was circular in shape. Diameter 1.9', depth 0.3'. The top was level with the floor. This basin was well made of puddled clay. The floor was made of hard, burnt clay Ca. 0.2' thick and covered the entire inside area, running close up against the walls.</wpa:narrative>
