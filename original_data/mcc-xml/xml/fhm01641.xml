  <wpa:narrative>This burial was deposited in a deep circular pit, sunk from a point near the top of Stratum II (lower). The burial was virtually disintegrated, but careful removal of the pit fill showed outlines pretty definitely indicating that a tightly flexed individual had been interred. No bones were recovered. A heavy rain eroded a bank of earth into the pit before work was completed on the burial, preventing any photos of the burial. A photo of this pit in cross section was made. Half of this pit extended into a square from which Stratum II was not removed.</wpa:narrative>
