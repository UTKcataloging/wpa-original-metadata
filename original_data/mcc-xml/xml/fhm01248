  <wpa:narrative>[Feature 37] This structure is delineated by a post mold pattern of fairly deep molds. The corners are closed and square and no wall molds were found. The North wall is rather indefinite because of disturbance. Most of the plotted postmolds for this wall are correct but at the Northeast corner there is some uncertainty. The floor is of hard baked clay Ca. 0.2' thick in the central section but rather indefinite near the walls. The fire basin (Feat. 45) that, in all probability, is associated, has been written as a separate feature and not plotted here because the great number of post molds in this vicinity and the fact that at least one or two other structures are present here makes it impossible to definitely state which structure the basin goes with. Over the entire structure lay a thin layer of burnt material (Feat. 33). This material, of course, lay over the other structure or structures in this area and cannot be said to belong only to this one. [Feature 45] Basin is on 3rd 6" level and on the floor of a structure. However, the great number of post molds and presence of another basin makes the identification of structure with basin doubtful. Nevertheless, it is probable that the basin belongs in structure Feature 37. Basin is circular in form with rounded bottom and is level with the floor, having no raised rim. It is made of puddled clay burnt brick red and was filled with white ash. Hard baked floor of structure surrounds entire basin. [Feature 46] Fire basin just south of Feature 45 basin but on a slightly higher level since the floor of Feature 37 runs under the basin. This basin was placed on a structure floor, but because of the great number of post molds in this area it is very difficult to assign the basin to any definite structure. Basin is raised above the floor ca. .4' and has a rim or curb .6' to .7' thick. The basin itself is circular, made of puddled clay burnt a brick red. It was filled with white ashes. Rounded bottom taking its slope from the side.</wpa:narrative>
