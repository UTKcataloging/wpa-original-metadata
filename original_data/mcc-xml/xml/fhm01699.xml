  <wpa:narrative>This burial was deposited in the bottom section of the mound, about 8.0' above subsoil. The grave consisted of side stones, a head stone, and several cover stones. There was no end stone at the foot of the grave. The stones used were roughly flat, soft and yellowish in appearance. There were no floor stones, the skeleton being deposited on the fill earth that was the bottom of the grave. In view of the fact that it would have been nearly impossible to have forced a fleshed corpse into a grave as narrow as this, it seems possible that this may have been a reburial (See notes on burial 3SW7, much of which might be true here).</wpa:narrative>
