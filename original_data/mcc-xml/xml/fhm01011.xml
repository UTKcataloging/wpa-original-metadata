  <wpa:narrative>This structure was wholly covered by broken burnt daub. Above this in an area confined to the limits of the structure was a layer about a half foot thick of rich black humus heavily loaded with shell, potsherds, animal bone, etc., clearly a refuse deposit. From this evidence we are led to suspect that a depression existed in which the structure stood, and that after the abandonment of the house site the depression was used as a garbage dump. This evidence occurs repeatedly in other houses on the site and will be discussed again as it arises. </wpa:narrative>
  <wpa:comments>There are two house forms on file for this photograph with different narrative information for each one. Additional narrative information on file at the institution.</wpa:comments>
