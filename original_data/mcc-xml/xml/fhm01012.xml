  <wpa:narrative>[Burial 44] This burial pit was not encountered until level 4 was reached, however, it seems likely that it originated from above this, probably from level 3. At both ends of the burial were upright slate or shale slabs, and over the skeleton, except for the skull, was another slab covering the legs and torso and touching the bone. Apparently the slab was laid directly on the body. There were no artifacts.</wpa:narrative>
