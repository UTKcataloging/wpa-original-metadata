  <wpa:narrative>Note the pole angling in from the corner and the lattice effect of the other material. [Feature 55] Burned clay floor and rectangular postmold pattern at Floor R level. The floor of this structure consisted of burned packed clay. The quantity of charred superstructure (cane, bark, thatch and logs) on the floor suggest that the structure had burned, possibly explaining the thorough burning of the floor. The vertical posts were set in trenches about 1.5' deep - the ends of the posts protruding through the bottom of the trench. Segmented horizontal log molds were laid in the trenches high on the interior and low on the exterior (about 0.5' below the floor inside and about 1.2' below the floor on the outside.) The trenches extended nearly to the corners of the structure, however, at least one, two, or three of the corner posts were not set in trenches. The corner posts are smaller and not over 1.0' deep. Several interior postmolds suggest the presence of furniture. A fill of about 0.5' (average) intervened between the floor and the top of the old humus layer (Level #2).</wpa:narrative>
