  <wpa:narrative>This mound is located in a plowed field. It is about fifty feet above the Powell River and 1400' south from Mound number 1, on the McCarty Farm. Within this mound on the floor was found the remains of a double walled structure measured about 19' north to south and 24' east to west. Outer rows of post molds measured 24'6" north to south and 27' east to west. Within this structure along the east side was found a circular firepit, lined with stones. A ditch had been made and the poles, forming the structure, were placed in this ditch and earth packed in about the poles, making them firmly imbedded in the ground.</wpa:narrative>
