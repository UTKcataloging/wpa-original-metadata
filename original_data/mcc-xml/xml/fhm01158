  <wpa:narrative>This structure is delineated by post molds spaced regularly and rather close together, ranging from 1' apart on the North and West to 3' on the East. It is rectangular in shape and shows no careful orientation on Level B. There is a fire basin, almost centrally located, made of puddled clay, 2.5' in diameter, and 0.6' deep. The rim of the basin is irregular and level with the floor of the structure (determined by level of post molds since no definite floor was found). ...The absence of wall molds is the only thing to differentiate this building from the common form found in this area. The closed square corners and vertical post molds placed without support a the base indicate a form wherein the walls and roof were made as separate units.</wpa:narrative>
