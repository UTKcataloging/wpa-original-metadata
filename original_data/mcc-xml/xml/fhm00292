  <wpa:narrative>Mound No. 1 is the larger of a group of two earth mounds and occupies a position on a cleared field on the inner bend of a small stream, Davis Creek. Cumberland Mountain lies to the north, about a mile air-line. Its nearest crest is about two thousand feet elevation. Southward, the terrain rises irregularly, forming a ridge of foot hill. The height of this mound has been reduced considerably, since it has been subject to plowing and erosion for many years. The owner of the property, on which it is located, stated that he can remember when it was several feet higher. An effort had been made, during the past years of cultivation of the mound, to reduce its height, in order to facitlitate cultivation. The erosion materials had increased the dimensions of the mound to a great extent.</wpa:narrative>
