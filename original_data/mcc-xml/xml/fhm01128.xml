  <wpa:narrative>A bench 5' in width and .8' in height extended around the inside of the floor wall. Projecting from rear bench is a formation which resembles a seat. Circular ash pits with molded clay rims occurred in two diagonally opposite corners. Dirt was banked up against the outside walls, probably to exclude surface water from the benches. Floor and inner curbing of benches had been fired to harden them; hearth in center has square outline and square fire pit. This is the only example of this type of house structure found in the village site. It is 23' square with moderate sized post molds and rounding corners. Outside the wall posts dirt was thrown up about .5' - .6' high, probably to make the structure weatherproof. Inside the wall of the structure was a bench 5' wide all around the central depression and at the SE corner at the inside edge of the bench was a small seat-like arrangement built of hard burnt clay. This seat was 2.5' wide next to the bench and 2.8' wide on the inside. This seat extends 1.3' from the bench into the central part of the structure. The bench is raised .7' - .8' above the floor of the structure and has a hard baked curb extending from the floor to the top and rounding back about .5' on the bench. The rest of the bench is made of clay and humus soil, and as before mentioned, extends back to the wall of the house. The floor proper is made of clay burnt dull red about .05' and packed hard to a depth of .25'. It is about 13' sq. and in the corners at the edges where the curb of the bench meets the floor the shape is rounding. At the NE and SW corners are two cache pits, the edges of which are raised above the floor .1' by a ridge of yellow clay. The pit in the S.W. corner is 1.6' in diameter and 1.9 deep; the pit in the N.E. corner is 2.1' in diameter and 1.5' in depth. Both these pits are much narrower at the bottom than at the top, being about .6' in diameter. The central fire basin is square in shape and has a width of 3.2' - the rim being .3' thick. The basin is raised about .2' above the floor and has a depth of .9'. Inside the rim is a ledge .4' wide and .2' below the rim. The deep section of the basin is 1.6 wide and is .6' below the ledge. A feature of interest is the fact that the bench on the west side has been worn down so that it slopes down from the curb to the wall. At all other places the bench is fairly level on the same plane. On the bench and over the floor was an indefinite layer of burnt cane and small logs. Over this was considerable wattlework (Feature 30). No evidence of an entrance has been found. A number of F.S. specimens were associated, most important of which were two pots found on the bench.</wpa:narrative>
