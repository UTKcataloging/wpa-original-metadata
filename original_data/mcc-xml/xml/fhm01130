  <wpa:narrative>[Feature 35] Dimensions were 20.5' x 20'. This structure is the top one of 3 structures almost directly superimposed. It is square with slightly rounding corners as delineated by post molds. The floor is indefinite around the walls but near the fire basin it is of burnt clay. The fire basin of structures 40-41 were leveled and covered with burnt clay so as to form part of the floor. The central fire basin is 1.6' inside diameter and has a rim of 0.5' thickness. The rim is 0.4' above the floor and has a depth of 0.8'. In general shape it is square. [Feature 40] This structure is delineated by post molds, is almost square and has rounding corners. The structure was directly under Feature 35 and either just over or just under Feature 41, hence no floor can be definitely assigned to this structure. The fire basin had been covered with a layer of burnt clay to form part of the floor of Feature 35 and hence may have been partially destroyed. No rim can be found with this basin. The basin originally was square with a width of 2' and a depth of .7'. At a later period clay had been packed in the 4 corners and tended to round the basin. The puddled clay was burnt to a depth of .1'. [Feature 41] This structure is delineated by post molds and has slightly rounding corners. It was directly under Feature 35 and either just over or just under Feature 40. No floor is apparent and the rim of the fire basin may have been destroyed by Feature 35. At any rate it was covered by a layer of burnt clay. The central fire basin is round and has a diameter of 2' and a depth of 0.6'. The puddled clay is burnt 0.1' thick.</wpa:narrative>
