  <wpa:narrative>[Feature 17] Third mold pattern. Post molds outline a structure. This was the third lineup of postmolds encountered after the mound was topped. The East row was quite definite. At the time the photo was made, the holes varied from 12" to 15" in depth, but when originally found were considerably deeper. It was very difficult to locate the South row of holes, and it is not certain that these shown in the photo and on the chart are the ones actually belonging to this structure. It is possible that these came down from the level of Feature 16. On the North end, no holes could be found, except a few near the Northeast corner. The mound was cut away carefully on this side in an effort to located a side of the structure. It is possible that they were cut away. But no indications were exhibited on the vertical face, when the excavating took place. No floor could be found that actually belonged to this outline of molds.... [Feature 18] Post molds outlining a structure. This structure could not be completed. The row shown in green [observer's illustration] possibly came down from above. [Feature 19] Post molds outlining a definite structure. This structure could not be completed because of the extention downward of Features 14 and 15. A well defined floor was enclosed by this structure, a solid built up floor. It was not easily followed; only around the center was it definite. A series of postmolds (Feature 21) showed up within this one, a few inches lower. The molds of both of these were deep. A double row of molds formed the East side of this feature. [Feature 21] An irregular outline of post molds, probably a structure. This structure is very irregular and could not be completed because of the extention downward of Features 14 and 15. No floor level was found when the excavating was continued. [Feature 22] These two lines of postmolds were cleaned and charted because they lined up so perfectly. Many of them are extremely shallow, being the bottom of ones cut out above. There were many others close to these, which were not re-charted, since it was evident that they had come down from an upper level.</wpa:narrative>
