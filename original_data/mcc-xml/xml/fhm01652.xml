  <wpa:narrative>This feature represents a separate unit situated within the Mississippi village. It was given a Feature number because it was located in the excavation of 85VT1RH41. It comprises a sand mound erected upon the same land surface upon which the Mississippi village exists. The mound was constructed of dark humic sand and light sands obtained from areas around the mound on the W, N, E, and part of the SE side. This was done by scooping out the sand, and resulted in the extensive borrow pit, which was later filled in by the Mississippi peoples. A number of burials were found within the confines of this mound. Several of them were definitely inclusive and some illustrated good Woodland traits, which gives a Woodland cultural origin to this mound. Other burials were intrusive. Generally speaking, the burial complex of this mound was very confusing. For an elaboration on detail of this feature, see the excavator's report and the ground plans for Feature 4.</wpa:narrative>
