  <wpa:narrative>Possible root or rodent burrow filled with sand. Narrow, deep, horizontal molds filled with sand. The data on this feature was inadvertently lost so that its exact location is not known. Definitely it was above Floor G. It consisted of narrow crooked molds filled with sand which had one point of confluence. The whole situation looked like nothing more than a rotted out stump, the root molds of which had een filled with fine white sand. Its exotic appearance was responsible for its designation as a feature at a time when it had not been fully explored. </wpa:narrative>
