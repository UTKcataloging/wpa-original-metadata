  <wpa:narrative>[Pit 77] A distinct circular kettle-shaped pit with inward sloping sides toward the top, and rounding near bottom to a flat bottom. Fill is dark humic soil, with charcoal flecks, varying in degree of color in a more or less stratified manner. Small amount of shell and some ash in bottom. Pit is intrusive to large circular pit on west side. A few small stones and one large one about 0.9' x 0.4' x 0.7' (sandstone) in fill. [Pit 95] Large, deep circular kettle-shaped pit. Pit intruded by Pit 77. Filled with dark humic sand and light sand. Few stones in fill. Pit similar to some of the deep burial pits on this side. Only part of this pit was dug completely but no burial was found. If it contained a burial it could easily have disintegrated completely. Pit seemed to flare toward top. </wpa:narrative>
