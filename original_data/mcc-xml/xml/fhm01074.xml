  <wpa:narrative>Burned daub covered the center of floor and thinned out. Note Wynn's intrusive pit around 69R7 in foreground. Floor in center is superb. The greater part of the south wall, background, has been plowed away and the southwest corner cut down by excavation in the originial 20 ft. cut. This feature has a fine, hard floor. The fallen daub and this floor both lie mostly in the Northern and Western halves of the structure. The rest was, of course, destroyed by the plow. There is a large, irregular pit around stake 69R7 which was dug by farmer Wynn in search of his pots.</wpa:narrative>
