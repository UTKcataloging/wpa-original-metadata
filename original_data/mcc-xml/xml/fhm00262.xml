  <wpa:narrative>In removing Lev. 2 in squares 1R10 and 1R11, a set of post molds was exposed originating at the base of Lev. 2. Arbitrary Lev. 2 more or less corresponds in thickness to the general black, sandy, humic deposit which extends over most of the southwest edge of the grid system. Various cultural features are intrusive to this more or less sterile zone, for example, Feature 5, and a number of burials and a large number of miscellaneous postmolds. See NB page 18 and 19. A number of postmolds in the 0 and 1 sections are precedent to the zone. Feature 23 is adjacent to Feature 5, yet the two features must be considered separate in point of chronology because of the interesting natural soil zone. No diefinite floor level or pit outline could be discerned for Feature 23 in the 1R10 and 1R11 squares where the feature was uncovered horizontally for a photograph. The fire basin is small, circular and shallow. The bottom is nearly flat but tends to merge in a curve with the short sides - the top of the rim is smoothed off but is not strictly combed. The basin was filled with compacted ash and a few sherds and animal bones. Photo 160By13 showed only the north half of the structure which shows an orderly postmold pattern--the south half of the structure as mentioned was cut away in putting down the initial trench of excavation on the site -- the postmolds recorded for the south half of the structure show no satisfactory indications of a pattern....</wpa:narrative>
