  <wpa:narrative>As in the case of 43HS6, this structure was found under one foot of mound loading and was the first structure encountered. If a structure existed on the top of the loading, no sign of it was encountered. It is of interest to note that an old wagon road ran across the mound. The structure is square being delineated by wall molds and post molds. No internal features were found and neither was there any evidence of a fire burning the dwelling. Apparently it had been cleared before the mound was built over it.</wpa:narrative>
