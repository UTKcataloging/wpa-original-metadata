  <wpa:narrative>This rock pile was rectangular in shape and was very carefully made by the piling of small rocks over the entire area. While the rock pile is flat on top, it slopes from east to west. On the west side there is only a single layer of rock lying on the old humus while at the east end there are several layers of rock. When these rocks were removed, a grey humic band was found and in some areas this was quite black; however, there wasn't the slightest sign of bone and if any burials had been present, it was impossible to identify such remains unless those areas that were so black could be identified. It would seem that burials should be affected here if direct comparison is made with 6SW1. It is to be noted that the soil was extremely wet or moist when the rocks were removed and it is probable that this was a contributing factor.</wpa:narrative>
