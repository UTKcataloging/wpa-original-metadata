  <wpa:narrative>Village site to the west of earthwork 37MG31. The palisade trench was relocated in the S-end of Fairbanks' excavation trench. It was traced and charted to scale (1" to 5') for approx. 43 lineal feet. The remainder of the trench to the island bank on the Tenn. River Slough was traced by sinking spot trenches or a series of test pits of varying size and at intervals of from 5' to 15', these locating the trench, and the unexcavated sections being interpolated on a map. The major part of the palisade trench was mapped by alidade and plane table on a scale of 1" to 40'. West of the slough (through which the palisade originally extended) the trench was continuous in all places exposed except in Square 10L9 where the trench was broken, the ends rounded, and a space of about 1.6' between the ends. In the approx. center was a mold about 0.6' in diameter. This, possibly was a means of entrance. ...The palisade, including Fairbanks' section, extends approx. 570 lineal feet W of the slough.... ...The palisade runs in a fairly regular manner from the Tennessee River bank on the NW side of the island to the Tennessee River slough bank on the NE.</wpa:narrative>
