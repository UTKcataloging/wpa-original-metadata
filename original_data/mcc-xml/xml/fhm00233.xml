  <wpa:narrative>Semi-subterranean structure with central firebasin. Only edge of pit in Southern and Western sides could be traced. Soil was sandy and seemed to be disturbed. Floor was very uneven being 0.4' higher at Eastern side than at Western part. Firebasin consisted of two nearly separate stages; first was very uneven on bottom but hard and sides were completely cut away before building second. Second basin round without evident curb; lined with hard baked puddled clay. Floor was only found North of basin. North edge of floor was broken over large stump which seems to have been precendent to structure as it was filled with refuse but not burned clay as would have occurred if it had cut through floor. No entrance trenches were found but entire Eastern edge was cut away before presence of structure was realized. West of firebasin was long narrow trench in floor; this may have been incidental to preliminary test pit sunk before excavation of this site was begun. No evidence that structure was burned. No large scale ground plan made as is is felt that this structure was disturbed by preliminary approach that the present ground plan does not represent a proper picture of it. See general ground plan and note book p. 117.</wpa:narrative>
