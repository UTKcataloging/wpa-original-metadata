  <wpa:narrative>This structure is nearly square, lies directly below Feature 18 and is delineated by post molds set in wall molds. The molds are quite small, irregular and not extremely deep. The floor is burnt hard in places while the rest is hard packed clay. The fire basin is the smallest I've ever seen, being 0.5' in diameter, 0.3' deep and filled with charcoal and ash. It is made of puddled clay burnt brick red and level with the floor. Around it is a burnt section of floor. The floor has the same dip at the north end as was noted for Feature 18 and conforms in shape. The wall trenches stop short of the corners, however, corner posts were used. The south wall stops far short of the south east corner although the post molds continue as on the other sides; this may possibly have been the entrance. The wall trenches were filled with earth and showed no evidence of horizontal log molds, either at the top or bottom. Here again is the problem of the function and use of the wall trench with two possibilities presented, that they were excavated so that supports could be placed against the wall posts to keep them in place in spite of the strain placed on them, or 2. that they were dug because that was the way in which the posts could be most easily placed in the ground. In either case objections must be met. In the first instance we must account for the lack of any evidence of the supports placed in the trench and in the second case we have corner posts placed in the ground without the aide of wall trenches, thus indicating that posts could be so set and that the wall trench, while making the job easier, nevertheless were not essential.</wpa:narrative>
