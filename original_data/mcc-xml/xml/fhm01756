  <wpa:narrative>[Mound 2] This mound which was two feet in height contained the partial remains of one burial which had been disturbed. The burial had large limestone slabs placed on end at the sides of the grave. Two other stone cists were found but no human bones were found in them. These appeared to be two other graves, in the form which they were in. There were only two post holes found in the mound, which would indicate that it was intended for a burial, and not a house mound. On the surface of the mound before excavation several large limestone slabs were plowed out. The mound is in an old corn field, about forty feet above the Powell River, which runs to the north and east and west, in the bend of the river. This mound is about 900' east of Mound number 1 and a little to the north. It is 1300' west from the Powell River. [Burial 4UN1] A few pieces of burnt wood over lower jaw, which appears to have been burnt in place. A stone was placed over burnt area and several small stones on side. Bone partly burnt.</wpa:narrative>
