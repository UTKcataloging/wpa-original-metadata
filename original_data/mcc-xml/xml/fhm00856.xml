  <wpa:narrative>[Feature 41] A pit dug in the mound from the Floor G level. A large broken fragment of the floor material of Feature 42 lay over the top where it had broken off the floor and dropped with the slumping of the pit. [Feature 42] The postmolds are so numerous and irregularly placed that the square outlines of the feature are rather indefinite. The floor occupies only about 1/2 of the interior of the feature. Feature 42 is adjacent to Feature 56 on the east but the two features are at slightly different levels making it impossible to state definitely that the two are contemporaneous or that Feature 56 is slightly precedent.</wpa:narrative>
