  <wpa:narrative>This structure is delineated by post molds on 3 and part of the 4th side. At the Northeast corner, two charred logs were found in a trench with charred butt ends of posts alongside. These logs had evidently been set in the ground to form a base support for the sapling posts that were used as support for the side walls and may have been bent over to make a dome-shaped roof. These two logs are the only evidence that the structure had burned down. A small fire basin, Feature 2, was in the center of the structure.</wpa:narrative>
