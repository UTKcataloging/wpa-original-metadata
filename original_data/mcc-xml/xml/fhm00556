  <wpa:narrative>On the NE side of this fire place is a partial cleft or shelf. This was not cut with a shovel. The excavation was made from the south side and the workmans shovel cut a small niche in this end. Pit in center is 18" in diameter and circular. The width along the outer border of the niche is 18" and extends inward for 13". From bottom which was on humus line extending downward to the hard pan was a 9" layer of mixed clay and humus. After demolishing the fireplace a circular pit was found underneath of the following dimensions 3' E.W. 2' N.S. and 2' deep. In this was potsherds, burned fragments of animal bone mixed with ash and charcoal. A large stone was found associated with niche on northeast side of fireplace. It is possible that stone fitted into niche or was dropped on fireplace causing area to be broken out. See photo 5-161 for relationship of stone to niche as fireplace was uncovered.</wpa:narrative>
