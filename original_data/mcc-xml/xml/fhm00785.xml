  <wpa:narrative>In S.E. corner post mold pattern was obliterated by later intrusive burial 6HA6. The floor was fragmentary, due to breakage by plow. Its origin, where certain, was the same depth as the postmolds - possibly as much as 0.2' higher. The association of floor and molds is not questioned. The midden pit has a burned clay lining on the northern edge.</wpa:narrative>
