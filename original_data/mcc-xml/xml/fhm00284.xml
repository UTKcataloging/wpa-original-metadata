  <wpa:narrative>Note associated (?) pits adjacent to basins. Large black pit with limestone rocks on outline of burned clay. This is a double fire pit with three associated pit outlines adjacent to the double fire pit. This double fire pit contained a rich black humic fill level with the rim. Fifty-six white limestone rocks lay in the top level of this fill. Small pockets of red ash appeared in the lining of the bowl. The double fire pit was intrusive to the three pits adjacent on the north, east, and south. This fire pit should not be confused with the specially prepared hard baked, red clay fire basins of 16BY13. In this case it is scarcely more than a hole in the ground showing a very thin layer of burned red soil in patches in the lining. Pit No. 15 contained a tightly flexed burial No. 17BY33. The rim of this pit was 6.1 and the burial lay at 6.9. Pits Nos. 16 and 14 were both midden pits containing broken pottery and refuse. </wpa:narrative>
