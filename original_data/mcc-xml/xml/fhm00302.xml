  <wpa:narrative> Probably a small dwelling house. Well defined structure outline which lies outside mound limits, except possibly a few feet of the northern end which extended under it, precedent to same. Numerous post molds appeared within the structure area, most of which probably had no connection with the structure itself. A row of molds running E and W extended through the structure (see chart and photographs) and may have been an arbor, since no additional lines could be found that would complete a larger structure. The row extends some twenty feet eastward and about fifteen feet westward. Since this line runs directly through the structure, it is quite probable that the arbor was precedent or constructed at a later date than the structure through which it runs. Note: on the east side a trench was sunk to a depth of 14" in to the hardpan, splitting the molds vertically, with no indications of a horizontal mold.</wpa:narrative>
