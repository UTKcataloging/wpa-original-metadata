  <wpa:narrative>Floor pattern of house circle before excavation exhibiting burned remains of building and two pottery trowels. [Feature 1] This burned area covers the entire circular structure and is composed of clay burned brick red, and charred logs and cane. It is the result of a conflagration of the structure. The logs appear to have been part of the roof since they do not orient with any of the post molds and for the most part are too small to have served as wall posts. The evidence points to the fact that the small saplings had been woven in such a way as to make a good base for the thatch. The structure was probably covered with an unfired clay since around the walls there is a great deal of burned clay but no brickettes. [Feature 2] This square structure is outlined by post molds and in some cases parts of posts are still visible in a charred condition. Along the post molds at the North-West corner and at the East end of the South wall are charred logs lying parallel and next to the post molds. It may be that originally these logs have extended all the way around the inside of the structure and acted as supports for the posts. The posts were small saplings about 3" in diameter. The charred logs that have fallen appear to be from the roof. The evidence for this being the fact that none of the logs orient with the post molds as we would expect. that the side wall logs would do. The floor of the structure is burned hard and there is some evidence of sand.</wpa:narrative>
