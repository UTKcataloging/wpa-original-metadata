  <wpa:narrative>There was no floor which seemed directly related to this stucture. The post mold outline was complete, but the tops of these molds showed up at a slightly lower level than those of the sixth structure (Feature #29). The two clay firepits of this structure, (Feature #28) however, appeared at a slightly higher level than the clay firepit (Feature #31) of the sixth structure (Feature #29).</wpa:narrative>
