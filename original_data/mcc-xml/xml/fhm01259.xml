  <wpa:narrative>[Feature 58] This structure lies to the North of Feature 59 Mound and very definitely associates with it. Thus the North slope of this mound is nearly vertical and runs down to the low sloping bank of earth that is just on the outside of the post mold pattern. This earth bank was found along the south and west walls and apparently was laid up against the walls of the structure. On the west this bank is ca. 2.5' high and 5' thick. This bulk suggests that the structure was an earth lodge but other evidence is lacking since the earth over the entire structure seemed to have been Mound fill of Level F. Then there was nothing lying over the structure floor that could be considered as being earth fallen from the roof. The structure itself is rectangular, outlined by post molds set in wall trenches. The corners are open in that the wall trenches do not meet. However, there are small molds placed in the SW and NW corner to give a rounding effect. The floor is of hard packed sandy clay which, in many places has been burnt a dull red or blackened by soot. The structure itself shows no evidence of having been destroyed by fire. On the floor are a number of misc. post molds. At the west end two short parallel rows 6.5 long starting from the west wall and running at right angles form a small compartment. Along the central axis and ca. 12' east of the west wall is a large circular fire basin of hard burnt brick red clay. The maximum diameter is 4', the minimum or inside diameter is 2'. Thus the rim is 1' thick. The basin is raised .4' above the ground floor and is .5' deep. The basin was filled with ashes and charcoal. Just east of this basin is a large pit 1.5' deep, 12' long and 4' wide. The pit has a hard burnt surface on some areas of the side walls while other areas of yellow clay. Pit is very irregular and at the south end slopes gently to the bottom, a feature noted in other similar pits. South of the pit and 1.5' away from the south wall is a clay seat that has been built on the floor of the structure and after the floor was completed since the floor runs under it. This seat is 1.3' high, 5' long and 3' side. 5' west of the east wall and along the long central axis is a large clay area of irregular shape that has been laid on the floor sometime after the completion of the floor. This area is 6.5' long, 4.5' wide and extends .3' above the floor, however a certain amount of it may have been cut off before it was noticed, since there was no especially hardening of the surface. </wpa:narrative>
