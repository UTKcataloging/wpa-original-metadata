  <wpa:narrative>[Feature 36] Post molds, fire basin and packed clay and sand floor at level of fire basin and extending under charred structure. Small ridge of charred fragments of wood and cane contained within fire burned soil along northwest wall of the structure encasing the postmolds. We felt inclined to trace the SW and SE walls of this structure by fire lines in the soil - however no postmolds showed up to corroborate or confirm the former existence of structural walls. There is some evidence from the comparative freshness and softness of fill on this side of the mound that the original traces of this feature have been largely lost through some such an agency as erosion - later the surface was rebuilt and subsequent structures and mound fill added. [Feature 57] The trenches were filled with soft porous soil of a darker color than the surrounding floor level. No vertical postmolds could be determined in the trenches. Their presence and significance is anomalous.</wpa:narrative>
