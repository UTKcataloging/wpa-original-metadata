  <wpa:narrative>[Feature 3] This structure is delineated by a Post Mold pattern of deep molds widely spaced. In shape it is nearly square with rounded corners. However a slight amount of irregularity is apparent in that the sides do not run quite parallel. Feat. 6 fire basin may possibly be associated, but if so it isn't in the center of the structure. No wall molds were found and the indication of architectural form is that of loosely made 'brush arbor'. Historical material was found in and about the structure and hence the building can be associated with a late group and possibly Cherokee. [Feature 7] This structure lies on level A, is square and delineated by large and deep post molds which are vertical in cross section and rather widely spaced. The structure is very irregular in outline, appearing to have been very carelessly made. No fire basin was found in this structure (Feat. 6 can't be definitely associated) and it may be that intrusive Pit #1 destroyed all evidence of it. From the amount of burnt clay found in the pit this would seem to be the case. The structure was built without the use of a wall trench and the corners were closed. Architecturally a 'Brush Arbor' type of building is indicated - i.e. a loosely constructed building of poles and brush, however no concrete evidence of superstructure could be determined. That the building was historical was shown by the artifacts found nearby. Since the entire Level A and material above was formed by natural accumulation and not by Mound building activity we assume a rather late date - possibly Cherokee.</wpa:narrative>
