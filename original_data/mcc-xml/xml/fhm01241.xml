  <wpa:narrative>This structure lay directly above Feature 34 and was delineated by a post mold pattern with rounded corners. The structure was nearly square with a centrally located fire basin raised Ca. 0.2' above the floor. The basin had an inside diameter of 2.4' and a curb Ca. 0.5' thick. It was 0.4' deep. The post molds contained fragmentary bits of wood but none useable for dendrochronology. No definite floor could be found. Feature 32 burnt area seemed to overlie the structure, however this may have been due to the fact that the structure wasn't found until the burnt area was removed.</wpa:narrative>
