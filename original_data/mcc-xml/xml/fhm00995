  <wpa:narrative>While working out Feature 4, a rich midden deposit was discovered in square 10L12 and extending NW. This midden was designated as Feature 10 and was precedent to Feature 4. In removing this midden a fire basin and wall trenches were uncovered at the base of Level 2. Profiles of the midden showed the wall trenches extending upward only to a point about 0.1' to 0.2' above the base of Level 2. Another fire basin was discovered to the NE of the other basin which consisted of parts of a large jar with compact burnt clay inside, forming a base of pottery for the clay (See photos 3HY1, 5HY1). In this area are four structures closely superimposed in a haphazard fashion. Portions of the structure designated as 11A are fragmentary. All are open cornered with small posts. The fire basins cannot be definitely associated with any single trench pattern.</wpa:narrative>
