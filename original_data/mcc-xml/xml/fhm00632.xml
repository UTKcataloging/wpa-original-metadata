  <wpa:narrative>Diameter approximately 65'. About 5' in height, originally said to have been 5' or 6' higher. Tertiary floor encountered 1' below apex, badly torn up by plow and impossible to follow. Secondary floor 14" below tertiary at apex; primary 34" below secondary. Topography of the surrounding country is in the nature of low rolling foothills. Site is situated on level plowed field which has been cultivated for a half century or more. It overlooks the confluence of the Clinch and Powell Rivers. Inspection of the area surrounding the mound failed to reveal evidence of long occupation. No midden was noticeable on the fields and the owner stated that so far as he could recall nothing of that nature had been plowed up.</wpa:narrative>
