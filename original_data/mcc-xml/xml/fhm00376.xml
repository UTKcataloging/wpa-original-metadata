  <wpa:narrative>[Feature 26] There was no floor which seemed directly related to this structure. The post mold outline was complete, but the tops of these molds showed up at a slightly lower level than those of the sixth structure (Feature 29). The two clay firepits of this structure, (Feature 28) however, appeared at a slightly higher level than the clay firepit (Feature 31) of the sixth structure (Feature 29). [Feature 29] The floor of this structure and the fifth structure (Feature 26) seem to have been the same. That there were at one time two separate and complete structures occupying this level is attested by the two complete rectangular groups of post molds and the clay fire pits, (Features 28 and 31) so located as to be almost in the exact center of the post mold outlines. The post molds of this structure occurred at a slightly higher level than those of Feature 26. The fire pit (Feature 31) in the center of this structure, however, was at a lower level than the two fire bowls, (Feature 28) of Feature 21.</wpa:narrative>
