  <wpa:narrative>[Burial 3SW5] Burial placed in a small crudely made stone box. Soft stone slabs ca. 0.2'-0.3' thick were used. No bone was left of this individual although slight trace was seen of pulverized bone. No actual bone left. One very small section of almost disintegrated bone seen. [Burial 3SW6] This grave had been very carefully made of shale and sandstone slabs, however, pressure of earth above had caused many of the slabs to shift thus destroying the regularity. The floor stones had been made of this shale and had weathered to such an extent that very little remained. The bone had also disintegrated so that only small fragments were found. This grave was built directly over 3SW7 stone grave, although 0.2' or 0.3' of earth separted the floor stones from the top slabs. [Burial 3SW7] This burial was placed in its back in a well-made stone box grave of the Tennessee-Cumberland type. The bone was in an extremely poor state of preservation and this in spite of the fact that water drainage away from the burial was very good. Acidic soil and possibly considerable age are responsible. This was a double burial with 3SW7A. It hardly seems possible that two individuals in the flesh could have been placed in a stone box of this size and hence it seems necessary to postulate a reburial with the bones placed in more or less anatomical order. In support of this view is the fact that many bones are missing and futher that while anatomical order was preserved articulation would have been impossible in the following cases. Legs with pelvis, feet with legs, right arm with scapula. Further while the extended burial in the grave occupied a length of over 6' the fences size indicates an individual of Ca. 5'6" and this would indicate reburial. Bad as the bone preservation may be it would seem that some evidence of the ribs, pelvis, etc. would remain.</wpa:narrative>
