  <wpa:narrative>The first line in the foreground shows northern border of Feature 7. Second line shows south border. The third line show apparent fading out of Level no.2 humic deposit. Feature 9 is a pit of a Semi-subterranean structure with fire basins. The top of the pit was filled with a dark humic soild filled with scattered charcoal and burnt clay. The pit fill was extremely rich, twelve twenty-five pound bags of potsherds being removed from it. The top of the pit sloped from the north to the south, due probably to post-habitation erosion because there is a slight slope to the south on the surface. The pit at the north side was 1.2' deep and at the south 0.6' deep. The sides of the pit were nearly vertical..... On the cleaned floor, Feature 7 was visible, and it was evident that Feature 9 was intrusive to Feature 7. About 2 feet to the south of Feature 7 on the floor, a dark area was apparent and this seems to be the fading out of the old humus layer that was found south of the house, but does not seem to continue north of Feature 7. In the center of the house were three circular fire basins, only tow of which were complete. The larger of these two was superimposed over another which extended beyond its side. The smaller of the two complete basins had no elevated curb and had vertical sides, but both of the others had sloping sides and a raised curb that was part of an irregular burned floor around the basins. The basins were entirely filled with compact ash. There were several large pits in the floor of the structure three of which had burials in them. Two pits in the north half had infants buried along with what seems to be whole broken pots. (See burial forms for 16BY74, 16BY79, and 16BY75). Burial 16BY68 consisted of a few skull fragments lying on the floor. 16BY89 was an extended juvenile showing a pit with 16BY108, a fragmentary bundle reburial. There were no apparent entrance trenches but there was an irregularity in the east wall of the pit along with a shallow trench about 0.2' wide and 0.1' deep and about 2.7' long that suggests that it may have been the entrance.</wpa:narrative>
