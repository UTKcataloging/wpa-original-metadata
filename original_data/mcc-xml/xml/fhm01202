  <wpa:narrative>[Feature 30] This structure lies directly under Feature 28 and has been more or less destroyed by it. No sign of a floor remains and only the bottom of a fire basin. The basin was directly under that of Feature 28 and was practically destroyed by it. The North wall of Feature 28 went down through that of Feature 30 and so destroyed that wall of this structure. The structure is delineated by a post mold pattern, but except for a short section of the West wall, there is no sign of wall trenches. At the Southeast corner there are a number of very small molds that completely enclose the corner. Along the three walls are a series of small stake molds apparently used for reinforcement. Ca. 0.4' to 0.6' below the tops of the post molds and on the inside of the structure are log molds. These were probably laid in wall molds but no sign of this trench is apparent except on the west. The small stake molds are mostly on the outside of the structure and have no apparent association with the log molds found on the inside of the structure, on the south and east walls. The stake molds found on the inside were above the log molds and since they were vertical in cross section had no relationship to the log. On the west wall the stake molds were only present on the inside wall well beyond the limits of the wall trench. [Feature 33] This structure is delineated by a post mold pattern of three walls, being open at the North. The East and West walls were set in narrow wall molds, while the South wall was made up of a very irregular series of fairly large molds. No hard floor was found nor was there any burnt area. Structure is very similar to Feature 26 and probably was more or less of a lean-to against the South wall of Feature 30. Along the East and West wall on the inside of the structure were a series of small stake molds.</wpa:narrative>
