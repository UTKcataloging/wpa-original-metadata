  <wpa:narrative>The mound was completely covered with trees before excavation (cf photos 17-447, 17-500 and 17-501). The majority of the trees were sassafras, elm, and sweet-gum. One large poplar tree stands on the northern boundary of the mound and since it could not be cut, prevented complete excavation of the structure. The secondary floor was thirty-eight inches beneath the apex of the mound, and it was poorly preserved. Some years ago a potato cellar was sunk into the mound near the center. This is shown as a depression in the mound top (Photo 17-502). This cellar penetrated the secondary floor near the middle of the floor and if there were any central altar or fire place on this floor, it would have been destroyed by this excavation. The mound was built of varying grades of clay, loam and sand. Predominant was a heavy red clay, seen in cross-section as many small lenses. The sand was clean, white, and fine grained. A typical river sand. The primary floor was of small extent and obviously precedent. It was probably associated with the original village site and the mound erected over.</wpa:narrative>
