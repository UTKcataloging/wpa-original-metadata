  <wpa:narrative>. [Feature 7] This structure was found on subsoil, but in spite of this we could not find evidence of a house pit. Peculiarly, our profiles do not show the pits any better than horizontal faces. The floor of the structure apparently was on subsoil, although there were no sherds nor artifacts that could be assigned to the floor. The floor was burnt red around the fire basin, but other than this the floor seemed to be an accretive surface. [Feature 11] This feature represents at least five structures, perhaps more. There are five fire basins, differing only slightly in size, almost identical in other respects and covering a vertical distance of about 0.8'. The basins are all circular with sloping sides and rounded bottoms. ...There are five or more wall patterns, two or three of which are trench and post patterns with small (0.2' posts). There are traces of at least two other patterns made up of larger posts and no trenches. ...Over the whole area, and attributable to the last structure built, is a mass of burnt daub and charcoal.</wpa:narrative>
