  <wpa:narrative>Eastern part of semi-subterranean structure traced with difficulty, edge of pit was present but no definite line could be found. Rest of pit fairly good. Walls of pit vertical or very nearly so. Fill very black and rich in humic material and midden. Floor had fair cleavage but was not burned in any place. NE of firebasins was small area of puddled clay burned 0.1d. This did not appear to be floor but a small prepared area, upper surface slightly yellowed. Floors appeared to be covered with some occupational detritus packed upon it. Several small river pebbles lay on or slightly above floor. Near of at south side a large pile of rocks (128) and a smaller pile (2). These seem to have been just inside structure. West of basins a large pile of unburned clay, humus and large chunks of burned clay. Below this pile a large irregular pit. This appears to be an intrusive trench or pit, possibly quite recently by looters. The large pieces of burned clay are probably pieces of the firebasin wall destroyed by the pit. The firebasins were near the center. The westernmost is the later but is mostly destroyed by the intrusive pit. The walls are vertical , floor flat. It is built of hard baked puddled clay. The eastern firebasin is probably the earlier and is complete except where cut by the later basin. The basin is built of puddled clay and is slightly uneven. The upper part of the walls slope sharply but the bottom walls are vertical. No curbs were present on either basin. Both basins were filled with mixed earth. There are two sites of entrance trenches one north of the other. The northern one seems to be less well preserved than the southern. The entrance passage ways consisted of two parallel trenches without the cross trench at the interior ends. The presence of two entrance passages and two basins suggests the possibility that two separate structures are present here. However the firebasins seem to coinside more nearly than would be the case if two structures were present. Burial 16BY88 was near the NE corner and may well be inclusive in the structure. There seems to be a slight suggestion of pit edge to north of it. Burial 16BY138 lay under western edge of the large rock pile. When the rocks were present this burial seemed definitely under them. It is probably precedent to the structure. Over the entire area of the structure there were small flecks of weathered yellow clay. This was especially heavy at the western side and extended beyone the edge of the feature. This seems to represent the unburned wattle. A large amount of artifacts and sherds were recovered from fill and floor. The large number of post holes probably indicate long occupation. Very frequently one post mold touched another See note book pp. 85, 86, 88. </wpa:narrative>
