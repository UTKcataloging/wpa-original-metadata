  <wpa:narrative>[House 1] These structures first introduced selves at base of plowzone. First evidence were widespread and apparently disorderly patches of charcoal and burned thatch. Upon careful clearing, the charred patches resulted in the pattern shown on the plat house 1. NE and SE corners of one house showed burned. Slightly raised floor, (see X - section on plat of house 1). [House 2] NW corner of this house showed up first in lev 2 where plow had scraped off punch of top. Complete postmold pattern on N trench is charred, also most of those on E trench. W trench and most of S trench did not show until level 3, probably because this was low place and disturbance by plow and floods was greater. Firebasin in almost exact center is a quite nicely circular and smoothly sloped feature. What appears to be a partition trench appears to run from the W wall, seven feet inside the N wall about 2/3 the way across the house. A connecting partition wall runs from this to the N wall about 11' from the W wall. Pits within the house area occured under the superimposed house in Levels 3 and 4 and may be associated with the house.</wpa:narrative>
