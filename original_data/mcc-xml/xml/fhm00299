  <wpa:narrative>The midden material in which these stones occur lies in a depression in the mixed clay and humus layer just above the hardpan. Before uncovering this feature was dug out to a depth of 12 inches. The hardpan lay just beneath. There was no evidence of burning. A careful lookout was kept for burnt bone as this feature was excavated - none appeared. The stones were limestone and sandstone. None showed evidence of burning.</wpa:narrative>
