  <wpa:narrative>Oval rock wall encircling a mass crematory basin of Burial 3SW13. While excavating a north-south trench through this mound in the central section of the ramp, rock walls were encountered running at right angles across the trench and ca. 20' apart. These walls were made up of small chert rocks ranging from the size of a man's fist to the size of his head and piled up without any attempt at fitting or masonry. The walls ran up to within a few inches of the surface of the ramp and hence the north wall was very much higher than the south one. This north wall seemed to have been built up on the side slope of the original mound as a sort of rock facing. The wall was traced and the oval outline worked out before the earth fill inside was worked out. Except for the size of this rock wall the external appearance was very similar to that associated with Burial 3SW9, however, with this difference: that the rock of burial 9 was simply a ring around the top of the burial pit while this was a wall of stone built up from the burial level. The top earth inside this rock area was typical of the ramp fill except in square 9 and 9R1 where an oval column of burnt clay extended from a few inches below the surface to the underlying floor of the burial mass. At a datum depth of ca. 7', this burnt clay spread over the entire area within the rock wall. This burnt clay was removed with trowels and revealed a large number of cremated individuals and evidence of charred logs. This burnt material ran back under the north rock wall and hence several feet of it had to be removed in order to trowel out the burial. This seems to indicate that the wall was built after the burial had taken place. There seemed to have been two general groups of burials here, a central group showing the most burning and a group to the East end that ranged from semi-cremation to bones showing no burning... It is important to realize that this rock wall was built after the cremation was completed and after Mound Phase C was built over Feature 2 rock pile and after Feature 4, the original rock wall of this burial tomb (3SW13), was partially covered by the fill of Phase C. This last point is of extreme importance in interpreting this entire burial complex with relation to the time element as can be seen from the 'notes' and digramatic sketch. This wall has been called inclusive in Phase B; actually it is Phase B, being called so because, 1st, it overlies Phase C (although its underlying association with C) and, 2nd, it is covered by Phase A with which it is not definitely associated. The time element here is indicated as being consecutive and quite rapid because, first, Phase C includes Feature 2 and the actual crematory period of 3SW1. second, Phase B was built shortly after the cremation was completed , and , third covered by Phase A, probably with little lapse of time.</wpa:narrative>
