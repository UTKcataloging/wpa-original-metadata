  <wpa:narrative>Between 8.0' east of R25 line and 6.0' west of R21 line. Shell heap contains skeletons 3HA4 and 3HA9 and denotes approximate depth of humus and habitation zone. 10.5' profile along 50' face. In the permanent grid system this is a profile of the 41 + 6.9' line between the R20 + 8.0' and the R25 + 8.0' lines. The "redeposited topsoil" is that layer which shows recent disturbance by plow. In addition it contains mussel shells, bone, and other cultural detritus which has apparently been washed in from the slopes to the north and west, and which may have made up an occupation layer on another section of the slope. It is a light, dull in color and loosely filled. The "old humus or occupation layer" is dark and loosely filled and apparently contains or has been subject to "humic acids." This layer contains the majority of cultural manifestations, refuse, and skeletons. Four skeletons have been found in this layer to date. The "weathered basic clay" so far as we can determine is self-descriptive. It is usually a buff shade and doesn't contain the fragments of "gravel" or "cherty-limestone" usually characteristic of the "basic clay." The "basic clay" underlies the above strata except where erosion has exposed it at the surface it is usually a deep red and contains the "gravel" fragments. There is usually no sharp demarkation beween "basic clay" and "weathered basic clay" - the distinction being a matter of degrees.</wpa:narrative>
