  <wpa:narrative> [Feature 1] Ten irregularly sized stones placed in a line and on their edges. These stones extend over a distance of 32 feet 6 inches. These stones are irregular in size and shape, some being 24" in diameter others 4". The material is limestone. No order in spacing is apparent but the dominance of the duo ratio is noticed. The length of the stones is as follows starting at stake three: 24", 14", 4", 10", 13", 6", 14", 9", 14", and 7". A diagram is appended to show the direction of the line. [Feature 7] A trench in the hard pan lined on the South side with limestone placed on the edge. The trench is 23 feet in length and 13 inches in width and extends in a SW-NE direction. Each end is rounded and gradually approaches the original surface as it nears the end. The ditch was dug in the hard pan which is 10 inches below the original ground surface at this point. Along the South border of the ditch are 17 flat limestones placed on edge thus forming a gutter for the ditch, none were found on the North side of the ditch. The ditch passes through a structure which is featured elsewhere. A diagram is appended. Some post molds associated but hard to trace due to fact that ditch was filled with dark loam which is soft and does not retain mold impression. [Feature 11] The post molds of a rectangular shaped structure. From the original ground surface to the hard pan (a distance of 6 inches) and into the hard pan for varying depths this series of post molds was traced. None of the posts were of any great diameter the largest being about 4 inches. The structure inclosed by these post molds has a length of 14 feet N.S., and a width of 12 feet E.W. At the S.W. corner of the structure no post molds were found thus leaving an opening at this corner of 18 inches, the probable door. [Feature 13] A pile of irregular shaped sand and limestones in the North East corner of a rectangular structure described in Feature 11. These stones seemingly are a part of the structure designated as Feature No. 11. Appended is the measurements of the stones in a diagram.</wpa:narrative>
