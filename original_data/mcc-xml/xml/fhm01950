  <wpa:narrative>[Feature 4 is associated with Feature 7]. [Feature 7]The floor of the structure is covered with a cane matting although in no place was a purposeful interlacing of the cane found. Above the split cane were a number of burned logs that originally formed the superstructure of the house. In a few cases, charred posts were found in place. However, the charred remains were not numerous enough to indicate structural form. In the center of the structure is a circular fire place of baked puddled clay. The rim is raised 0.1' above the floor. It has a diameter of 1.3' and a depth of 0.5'. The rim is 0.3' thick. The floor of the structure is burned hard over a considerable area of the fire basin. The structure is delineated by post molds and except for the NE corner, all the corners are rounded. The post holes are vertical showing no tendency to lean either one way or another. There were very few internal post molds. In the floor of the structure three more or less complete pots were found as well as a great many sherds. In square 53R3 a burial was let down through the structure from above. There were two cache pits inside the structure; one near the east wall and one near the west wall. [Feature 4] This area may well overly a structure since at the east end are a series of burned logs intermixed with the clay. Just beyond the burned clay at the east end a row of post molds cross the trench. The burnt clay averages .2' to .3' thick in the areas of greatest concentration - at other places only flecks of burnt clay appear. In many places the clay takes the form of wattle work thus indicating a burnt structure. In square 53R2 a burial pit (7HA6 and 7) was sunk into the clay from above.</wpa:narrative>
