  <wpa:narrative>This small earth mound is approximately forty feet in diameter and eight feet above the original ground surface at its mid point. Eight large trees were growing on the mound, the largest being a White Oak measuring twenty-three inches E-W. The roots of the these trees have penetrated the entire mound. The mound is situated on the farm of Wm. Freels, Anderson County. This farm has been in the possession of the Freels family for over one hundred and thirty-five years according to Mr. Freels, he being the fourth generation of the family to cultivate the land. The mound is in the bottom of a rather wide valley with a ridge on the east and west. The ridge on the east begins to rise abruptly three hundred feet from the mound, while the one on the west has a gradual rise reaching its peak approximately three-fourths of a mile away. The Clinch River lies to the East and South of the mound on the far side of the ridge to the east of the mound.</wpa:narrative>
