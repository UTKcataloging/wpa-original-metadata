  <wpa:narrative>This feature showed up at the top of level 2 as an extensive area of burnt soil and ash. The excavated circle shown was ash that was outlined by a line of charcoal. When excavated it showed over thirty striations of different colored ash in the sides. The trenches cut in the sides and the "L" in the center were used as a profile check on the nature of the deposit. This feature presented itself at the base of the plowline as a egg shaped area of ash surrounded by burnt soil and charcoal. When excavated there were over thirty strata of ash, but no evidence of any fires having burned on the spot. It is believed that this ash deposit was laid down here from ash cleared from some other fireplace, believed here to be feature 36, which has large fire basins, with little or no ash in them. This deposit was about 1.2' deep and below the plow - extended a little beyond the outline of the plowline.</wpa:narrative>
