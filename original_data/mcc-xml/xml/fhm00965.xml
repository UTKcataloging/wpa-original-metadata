  <wpa:narrative>This burned area covers the entire circular structure and is composed of clay burned brick red, and charred logs and cane. It is the result of a conflagration of the structure. The logs appear to have been part of the roof since they do not orient with any of the post molds and for the most part are too small to have served as wall posts. The evidence points to the fact that the small saplings had been woven in such a way as to make a good base for the thatch. The structure was probably covered with an unfired clay since around the walls there is a great deal of burned clay but no brickettes.</wpa:narrative>
