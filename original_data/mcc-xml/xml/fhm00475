  <wpa:narrative>Large molds, 8 to 10 inches in diameter, found within the outlines of the structure probably held the vertical posts which supported the roof. Photo made of cross-section of the roof supporting molds (photo no. 2-118). Upon continuing the excavation of the floor another row of molds was encountered 12" below and about 12" within the row of molds forming the southwest wall. The top of these molds began on the same plane where the outer row ended. In as much as the northwest portion of the floor was higher it is possible that a clay wall was built up to prevent the intrusion of rain water and the outer wall of posts sunk into this wall of clay. The diameters of the molds varied from 3" to 6".</wpa:narrative>
