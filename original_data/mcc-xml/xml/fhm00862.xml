  <wpa:narrative>[Feature 48] The remnants of a floor or occupational layer on top of the mound. Two small areas of badly cracked, burned clay and a burned clay fire basin with its upper portion apparently plowed or eroded away testified to the probability of the former existence of such a layer - only fragmentary evidence of a post mold design remained - it is not to be associated with the "floor" with certainty. [Feature 50] This is almost certainly a pit dug in the top of the mound by looters. The depth of the disturbance and the presence of an only slightly tarnished tin can in the bottom of it seems to justify such an assumption. There is subsequent confirmation of this statement.</wpa:narrative>
  <wpa:comments>There are two feature data forms on file for this one photograph, one for each feature. A field specimen was collected from Feature 50, however no F.S. number is available.</wpa:comments>
