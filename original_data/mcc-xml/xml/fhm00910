  <wpa:narrative>No wall trench apparent, compacted silt at level of tops of post molds suggests that it might have been a floor. The outline of the house showed as a pit first at a datum depth of 5.1'. It was necessary to cut down a matter of 0.5' in order to expose the post-molds demonstrating that the interior of the house had been hollowed out, hence the term "house pit" or "semi-subterranean house." A small quantity of charcoal and fire affected soil occurred at the North corner of the structure - possibly suggesting that the house had been burned. No other evidence to this effect however. Post molds average 0.3' - 0.4' in diameter.</wpa:narrative>
