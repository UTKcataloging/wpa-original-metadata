  <wpa:narrative>Smaller dwelling, Feature 2, has its south and west walls obliterated by these walls of Feature 1. Square 60R41. [Feature 1] Overlying the fire basin was a large section of scattered daub showing cane impression. All of this was broken into rather small pieces. It is probable that this daub associated with the superstructure of this dwelling. There was no other evidence that the structure had burnt. The post molds were rather irregular as to depth, many of them extending below the wall trenches, while others merely went to the bottom of the trench. There was no regularity observed for the posts which went below the trenches. [Feature 2] Judging from depth of wall trenches and superposition of trenches this structure lay ca. 0.1' under feature 1. Many of the wall posts extended below the bottom of the trenches, while most of them simply stopped at the bottom.</wpa:narrative>
