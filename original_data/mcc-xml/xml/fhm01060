  <wpa:narrative>[Pit 4] This is a pit similar to pits 1, 2, and 3 in that it has burnt sides and unburnt bottom. In the main the sides are vertical though the north side bellies out slightly. The fill is humus with considerable flints and animal bone. There was very little shell, though shell was present. This pit probably was a garbage pit.</wpa:narrative>
