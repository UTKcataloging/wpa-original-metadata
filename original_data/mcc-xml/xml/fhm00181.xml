  <wpa:narrative>Double fire basin in center, 2 rows of postmolds cut across the picture roughly NE by SW in yellow clay SS. St. I, -2.0 This house, remarkably small as it is, had been used as a dwelling for some time, if one takes as evidence the 2 fire pits. These have 1 contiguous wall - the North. Small houses are I believe, going to be rather numerous on 14BN30. All of the floor and, perhaps .2' of the fire basins had been removed by the plow.</wpa:narrative>
