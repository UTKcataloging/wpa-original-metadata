  <wpa:narrative>This feature was first encountered during the first day of excavation and was given a feature number for future reference in case it proved to be a floor or other aboriginal feature. Further excavation, however, indicated that it occurs within the zone of recent cultivation. It is an irregularly shaped area of compacted sandy humus, not distinguished by any difference in color or texture. Varies from 0.1' to 0.3' in thickness. Probably the result of standing water.</wpa:narrative>
