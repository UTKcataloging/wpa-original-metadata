  <wpa:narrative>[Feature10] This structure lies directly over another (Feat. 11) and is delineated by small deep post molds very close together with the four corners left open (i.e. no molds found in corners). All the molds are vertical in cross-section, but many of them are not truly round in diameter. No historical material has been found with the structure but there are indications that Level B, on which this structure was built, was in use at least in early historical times. The fire basin was directly under the basin for Feat. 9 and hence is considerably destroyed; however it is centrally located, made of puddled clay with the top level with the structure floor. The molds in the S.E. corner were destroyed by an intrusive pit that came down from the top of the mound. Log molds were found for this dwelling after the upper part had been cut away. At the bottom of the molds were logs laid the length of the trench. Only charred fragments were found of the logs and in places the bark impressions on the ground was all that showed. The log molds were outside of the post mold pattern. The log molds, in a sense, are similar to wall trenches, however with this important difference, that they were not used to aid in setting the wall posts but simply to introduce some support for the posts at the extreme basal end. This would seem to indicate that the wall posts were subjected to some strain. However, it is to be noted that there were no apparent arrangements on the inside of the posts to help counteract a strain. Possibly a log laid above ground at the base of the posts was used. The wide open corners show no indication as to how they were closed on the superstructure. [Feature 15] This structure is delineated by a post mold pattern of fairly small vertical molds. The corners were left open but showed a variation from the normal plan at the east. Here the side walls extend all the way to the east wall, but the east wall is open for 5' or 6', giving, in effect, two openings on the east wall, one at either corner. The one corner found at the west end follows the normal pattern i.e. both walls stop 2 or 3' short of the actual corner. The fire basin in on the center line through the structure but is 22' from the west wall and 12 feet from the east. It is .6' deep, 1.5' in diameter and raised slightly above the floor of the structure and is surrounded by an area of burnt clay. The basin was made of puddled clay. There was a slight amount of burnt material on the floor and the indications are that the structure burnt. Slightly below the top of the post molds wall molds were found. These wall trenches were filled with earth and there were no indications of horizontal logs having been placed in them. Because of this the only apparent reason for the use of these molds was to facilitate the placing of the vertical wall posts and not for the placement of additional supports. Thus it must be noted that if horizontal log supports were not place in these molds the mold itself would tend to weaken the foundation of the posts because the ground could not be packed in as tightly as it originally was and hence the wall posts would be even less likely to be able to resist the strain of being bent over to a center point to form the roof. The question of importance is whether the decaying horizontal log in a wall mold would always leave an impression or evidence of its presence or not. I am inclined to believe some evidence of its presence would remain more often than not, hence we must believe that these molds were not always used for placement of support for wall posts, at least a strong doubt remains as to the function or functions of these wall trenches.</wpa:narrative>
