  <wpa:narrative>Note SE corner where no corner mold was found, but two large molds outside the trench ends, this suggesting a form of entrance. Small circular central fire basin also shown. No artifacts. Subsoil. [Feature 26] This structure was found on the subsoil, but, judging from the depth of the wall trenches and the fact that a bottom section of the fire basin was still intact, it probably originated on a habitation level just above the subsoil. The structure is delineated by wall trenches open at the corners and with corner molds. Through the length of the wall trenches small post molds ca. 0.3' in diameter were found at regular intervals of less than 1.' Ca. 0.5' below the top of the wall trenches were small log molds on the inside of the posts running the full length of the trench. There were no corresponding molds at the bottom of the trench, however, and there is little in the way of evidence to determine the method of constructing the superstructure. The posts were vertical in cross section.</wpa:narrative>
