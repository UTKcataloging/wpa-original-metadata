  <wpa:narrative>Area adjacent to burnt floor was cut down in an effort to locate a more regular post mold pattern. This small rectangular structure is the first structure found to have a hard baked floor and even here it is rather patchy. There is no definite post mold pattern although a series roughly follows the outer edge of the floor. This area contains a good many internal post molds and 3 small pits. The fire basin is well made of puddled clay but very small, having a diameter of 1' and a depth of 0.6'. The floor dips down Ca. 1' at the North and just inside of the North wall, however this seems to be due to mound settling. There was no evidence of superstructure form.</wpa:narrative>
