  <wpa:narrative>This small pyramidal mound is 27' x 23' at the base and 18.5' x 22.5' on top. The side slope on the East, West, and South sides is rather sharp, sloping at a ca. 80 degree angle. On the North side the slope is nearly vertical running down to Feature 58 structure. The corners on the md are quite sharp but nevertheless rounding in outline. On the top surface of this mound is a series of post molds, many of them misc. However, along the east side there is a row of 14 molds and on the south there are 7 molds forming an irregular row. Near the center is a burnt area 3.5 long and 2.5' wide. This area simply shows fire action on the sandy clay mound surface. These post molds were possibly used for a crude shelter of some sort. This mound lies south of the large ceremonial (earth lodge ?) structure and in all probability was associated with it much as were the pyramidal mound and structure of Level E. There is no direct connection between this mound and Feature 60 (Mound A and Level G) which lies to the west and hence there is no evidence as to whether they were contemporary or not.</wpa:narrative>
