  <wpa:narrative>This small rectangular structure is delineated by a closed wall trench pattern. The picture shows the structure cut down 0.2' below the floor level, however, in two places near the fire basin small sections of hard burnt floor can be seen. These two patches of floor were all that could be found and the fire basin had been destroyed in the rim section so that it wasn't found until 0.2' below the floor level. It is possible that originally this dwelling had a hard consolidated floor burnt hard in area near the basin. Of interest is the pile of stones (about the size of a doubled fist) lying near the basin. These show the action of fire and were probably used to boil water. Ca. 27 stones in the pile (stone pile 3). The fire basin was centrally located, was circular in shape, 0.8'deep, 1.7' N-S and 1.9' E-W. It was made of puddled clay burnt brick red. Since the top of the basin had been destroyed there was no evidence of the rim section. At the level of the two burnt patches showing in the picture was an extensive burnt area suggestive of floor, but not packed or consolidated. Some of this may have been material that fell on the floor when the structure was destroyed. There was, however, no evidence indicating that the structure had burned. There was no evidence of post molds in the wall trench, however, they could have been missed due to the dark nature of the trench fill.</wpa:narrative>
