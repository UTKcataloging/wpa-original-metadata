  <wpa:narrative>This stone box looked like the circular stone cist reported by Harrington - a burial was expected; however no bone, nor any sign of any was found and no hint as to the use of this feature was discernable. The bottom of the box was partially covered by flat limestone rocks. Throughout the center, a slightly burnt subsoil earth showed. The bottom rocks showed no signs of having been burnt.</wpa:narrative>
