  <wpa:narrative>[Feature 11] From the original ground surface to the hardpan (a distance of six inches) and into the hardpan for varying depths this series of post-molds was traced. None of the posts were of any great diameter the largest being 4 inches. The structure enclosed by these post-molds has a length of 14 feet N.S., and a width of 12 feet E.W. At the S.W. corner of the structure no post-molds were found thus leaving an opening at this corner of 18 inches, the probable door. [Feature 13] These stones seemingly are a part of the structure designated as Feature No. 11. Appended is the measurements of the stones in a diagram.</wpa:narrative>
