  <wpa:narrative>Proximity of structure to plow zone makes it impossible to determine whether the floor of this structure was semi-subterranean. The post molds around the edge of the structure were exposed in subsoil at the bottom of the plow zone. The central floor area was still present - the area immediately adjacent to the fire basin being considerably burned. The remainder was compacted and mottled in aspect. The bottom of the fire basin was burned to a depth of 0.3'. The areas of burned floor averaged 0.1-0.2' thick. The post mold pattern is irregular and scattered making it difficult to associate, definitely, all the post molds in the area with this structure.</wpa:narrative>
