  <wpa:narrative>Roof of cave varies from 12' in height near entrance to 40' near SW end of large vault. Cave considerably smaller from that point. Closely inspected for some 500' but no signs of aboriginal habitation encountered. Farther back many wooden structures present which were used by Confederate soldiers in the clarification of salt peter. A burial wrapped in cane and bark was reported to us by a local inhabitant who had observed it on a rock ledge abou 500' or more from the entrance. He was unable to locate it and the assumption is that is has been removed by someone during the past three years.</wpa:narrative>
