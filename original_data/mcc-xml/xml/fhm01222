  <wpa:narrative>This small structure lies on the lowest section of Level E to the West of all other features. It is delineated by a post mold pattern of small evenly spaced molds on the East and North sides but very irregular on the South. The West side was destroyed by the West Coordinate Trench. Apparently no specially prepared floor was used, but there are several burnt patches and considerable charred fragments of wood and grass on the floor. Not enough to give any evidence of a superstructure, however. On the floor on the Southeast corner is a considerable mass of unworked mussel shell. On the outside of the post molds was a log mold (along East section of North wall) averaging 0.2' deep , 0.5' wide and filled with decayed and charred log.</wpa:narrative>
