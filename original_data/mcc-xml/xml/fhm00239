  <wpa:narrative>[Feature 40] There are at least two and very probably three structures here. Artifacts and sherds were catalogued as from Feature 40, presence of additional structures could not be definitely assigned by level. Feature 40 has part of outline of pit, Feature 41 has also part of pit outline. The pits seem to be at a slight angle to each other - Feature 40 being aligned more WNW -SSE than the NW - SE of Feature 41. Feature 46 could not be assigned except on the basis of the extra firebasin. Feature 40 can probably be associated with entrance passage on southeast side. Entrance passage at East corner was partly cut away in digging drainage trench but seems to be possibly associated with feature 47. Walls of pit sloped out slightly but were fairly regular. Subsoil here is quite sandy and floor was in poor condition. Hard baked floor seems to be mainly associated with Feature 40. Apparently burned - others unburned. Wattle was fairly compact but sandy. Under wattle were remains of what appeared to be cane and/or bark thatch - very indefinite indications. Subsoil was overlain with thin, irregular layer of weathered clay; this may have been wattle of Feature 41 or it may have been floor added because of sandiness of subsoil. Burned timbers of Feature 40 were mainly oak and good dendrochronology specimens were obtained. Floors of Features 40 and 47 were covered with 0.2' ca, of detritus, baked around basin into hard floor.... Basin of Feature 40 had about 0.1' of puddled clay added symmetrically to floor and sides.... On floor of Feature 40 were found some shell of nuts (probably carya) and pits of wild plum (Prunus Americana). [Feature 41] Semi-subterranean structure with central firebasin. Lies below Feature 40 and possibly below Feature 47 through exact interrelation of Features 47 and 41 are not clear. Unburned structure. See form for Feature 40.</wpa:narrative>
