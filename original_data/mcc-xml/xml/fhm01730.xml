  <wpa:narrative>[30SW158] Top 1/2 in places. [30SW154] This bone was heaped outside of cist of 30SW151 on the west side. Since there was no superfluous bone within 30SW151 it is not thought that this skeleton had ever occupied the cist of 30SW151. 30SW154 probably occupied 30SW142 which is oriented west, thus putting the head-end of cist under 30SW154. 30SW142 and 30SW154 should be examined together in the laboratory. [30SW152] 30SW151 crossed this cist at the foot. Except for this, there was a complete cist. Fragmentary lower legs lay under 30SW151. A few scattered foot bones and the skull and jaw was all else that remained. [30SW150] Full top, sides, bottom, and ends apparently rotted away except for 3 fragments. [30SW163] Try 30SW168 and 30SW166 for bones to match. This cist was fairly complete, but the junction of four burials and a stump has confused the scene. [30SW104] This cist had very little dirt in it when opened. It had top, bottom, sides and end slabs. There were two fragmentary skulls, 30SW104 (child) and 30SW104A (infant). It could not be determined if one burial was precedent to the other or if they were simultaneous. Under the chest were a number of crinoid stems(?), possibly beads. [30SW104A] Long bones of 30SW104A should be sorted. See 30SW104 for sketch and remarks. [30SW165] All top in place. [30SW153] This cist was complete. Most ribs are in order. Long bones are scattered. [30SW166] Cut into by 30SW151. What remained of the cist was complete. Look at 30SW163 and 30SW168 for bone to match. See these two for remarks, also.</wpa:narrative>
