  <wpa:narrative>The east-west test trench south of the mound disclosed the post molds along the northeast corner of this structure. These were followed and the structure unearthed. The center hole is 2' deep and to the south lies a small fire pit rimmed with baked clay about 1/2" in thickness. At the probable doorway at the NE corner were 2 flat limestone rocks. The molds averaged 4" in diameter all around without smaller molds on the corners. The average distance apart being three inches. A clay embankment extended along the West end approximately three-quarters of its length. This was 5" above the floor level at its highest point. (Note -- Storms at present time come down through gap of mountains toward this same side of structure).</wpa:narrative>
