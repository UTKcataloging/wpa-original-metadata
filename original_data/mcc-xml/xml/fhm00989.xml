  <wpa:narrative>It is extremely difficult to interpret the meaning of this feature, although one is tempted to make a cross reference to the burial enclosure under the ramp of Mound 3SW1 on the Grey Farm in Stewart County. A resemblance certainly exists, but there is very little identity of traits. Physically this feature is composed of a group of flat slabs forming an oval enclosure, or would form one if the rocks on the east side were present. Their absence is confusing since there is no evidence of intrusion to suggest later removal. Inside of the enclosure is a dark humus clay of a nature corresponding to the Phase A fill of the Mound (Phase A in fact covers this feature). Under this soil is the yellow red subsoil of this region. No human bone or specimens, other than two sherds, were found in working thru this soil. After removal of the rocks a relatively deep trench was found running down ca. 1' into subsoil and in this trench one or two of the large rocks had settled- for the most part, however, the trench contained only black soil. Within the trench numerous circular to oval depressions appeared and these may have been the basal ends of posts, although no evidence of molds showed up above. The question of molds must remain in some doubt due to the irregular nature and scattered occurrence of these depressions. The rock wall and the trench seem to be associated. Three large circular pits through which the trench ran seem to preceed the digging of the trench and are certainly not to be associated. Stratigraphically this feature lies over the extreme outer edge of Phase B Mound fill and has been covered by Phase A which in this section of the Mound extends out beyond the 10R5 stake, and forms, roughly, an exaggerated ramp such as was so clearly defined on site 3SW1. </wpa:narrative>
