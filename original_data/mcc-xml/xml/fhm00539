  <wpa:narrative>The remains of a piece of post situated in a post mold that extended about 2" into the hard pan. The post was surrounded by a circular arrangement of rocks. Seven irregular limestone rocks roughly in a circle outline around the post. See photo 5-153. The tip of this post extended about 6" above the mound floor while the remaining portion extended down into the hard pan into which it projected a distance of 2". Upon digging out the post mold for this post it was seen to be circular and the bottom of the hole was shaped like a flat bowl. No side extensions could be followed from the post mold thus seemingly the post was in reality placed in this position and was not a tree.</wpa:narrative>
