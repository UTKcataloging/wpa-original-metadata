  <wpa:narrative>This was a crude looking ramp on the southeast sideslope of Phase B. Four steps were found, but more may have existed. The highest step lay at datum depth 4.3', the lowest at datum depth 10.0'. See Phase B DD 2.5' ground plan for the horizontal form and relationship of this ramp. The 48-line profile shows a part of the ramp. Note that the ramp is cut in the mottled black and yellow clay sideslolpe band associated with the early occupation of Phase B. Two very badly rotted logs were found on the steps of the ramp. They may have been cedar. One was at datum depth 4.9' the other at datum depth 7.4'. Note also that this ramp leads up to a projection at the summit towards the southeast. This combined with the profusion of postmolds on this section of the summit, would seem to indicate that an annex of some sort was on this part of the summit.</wpa:narrative>
