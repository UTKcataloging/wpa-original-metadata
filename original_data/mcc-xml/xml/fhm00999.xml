  <wpa:narrative>On the north end of the site, where the outline of the site runs into the roadway, in the extensive depression in subsoil designated as Feature 10 a large amount of charcoal and other charred material was encountered over an area about 20' x 20' in Level 2. Burnt thatch, burnt cane, burnt poles from 0.3' to 0.05' in diameter and a few burnt briquettes were distinguishable. Some very few sections of the material were intact enough to enable some study, but none of these sections seemed to represent a complete cross section of the superstructure. One section (a close up photograph was made of this) close to the wall trench seemed to represent a collapsed portion of a vertical post with a pole lying at right angles across it and then thatch at right angles above this and lying parallel to the vertical post. Another section showed parallel sections of cane which seemed to have run horizontally on the wall with thatch lying on it at right angles to it. No attempt was made to make a complete drawing of all this material, it being a mass of charcoal and charred material extending over the entire structure and in some instances being as much as 1.0' deep. The longest section of post or pole was less than a foot and all material intact enough for study was confined to small sections. From the floor near the NW corner, beneath the charred superstructure we recovered two small fragments of charred coarse fabric. The floor of the structure was exceedingly ambiguous. However two fire basins had their curbs on the same plane, and this plane we may assume is the floor. At the center of the west side of floor, beside the walls there is a bank of floor that raised up 0.4' above the floor level. Might we assume that the floor perhaps was banked up again to the walls on all sides and that this section was preserved by chance burning. The remainder of the floor was of mixed clay and midden. It seemed possible that sections of the floor had been "repaired" with specially prepared clay. The postmold and trench pattern of the structure is typical of the majority of the structures discovered. Postmolds were small (ca. 0.3'), interstices regular (0.4'), the trench depth 1.2', determined from floor level. The pattern was open cornered and is easily classified as Type 1. </wpa:narrative>
