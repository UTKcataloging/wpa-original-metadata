  <wpa:narrative>Small oblong "residential type" house in old occupation layer under the mound. The structure first appeared at the bottom of the humus layer as a larger, roughly rectangular pit. In working down on this the post molds appeared. It was necessary to cut well down into undisturbed soil to trace the trench lines on both the exterior and interior --because of fill of mound soil inside the limits of the house. The northern corner of the house was joined where the trench was continuous around this corner. Four interior post molds showed in each corner. A slightly burned area about 2.0' in diameter was exposed in the middle line of the SE 1/3 of the house. Apparently the humus and part of the subsoil had been scraped out to leave a depression around the edges of which wall trenches were dug and posts were set.</wpa:narrative>
