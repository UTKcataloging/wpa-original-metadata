  <wpa:narrative>Structure represented by floor, firebasin and postmold pattern. Floor lies just below plowzone and is scored by plow. Floor baked red, upper surface missing in some spots. On floor and in soil above were crumbs of baked clay that appear to have been wattle. Firebasin filled with wattle showing grass impressions. Upper edge of large baisn was plowed away, walls vertical, curve at bottom to flat hard floor. Floor of basin had black upper surface and was burned to depth of 0.35'. Second basin lies to S-E of large basin and is earlier than large basin. Second basin was mostly destroyed and only floor left. No outline of pit of Feature 14 ws found. Post mold pattern seems to indicate a rectangular structure. No evidence of entrance passage. Wattle and ash in firebasin seem to indicate structure was burned. Subsoil very sandy in this region.</wpa:narrative>
