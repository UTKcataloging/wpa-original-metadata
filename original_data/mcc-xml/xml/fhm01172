  <wpa:narrative>[Feature 16] This structure is delineated by an almost square post mold pattern with open corners. No sign of a wall mold was found. The post molds were very hard to find on the south and east and vertical cutting was resorted, hence in the picture it must be noted that the floor has been cut away, Ca. 0.5'. This can be seen because the central burnt area hasn't been cut down. The only feature of interest is the central burnt area on the floor and the four pits filled with blackened wattle work and charcoal that surrounded it. To the East of this another long pit that is partially filled with wattle has been found. Pit 1 is 7' long, 2' wide, .5' deep and filled with wattle work. Pit 2 is 10' long, 2' wide, .5' deep and filled with wattle work. Pit 3 is 4.5' long, 2' wide, .3' deep and filled with wattle work. Pit 4 is 7' long, 2' wide, .5' deep and filled with wattle work. Pit 5 is 4.5' long, 2.5' wide, .8' deep and filled with wattle work. None of these pits are lined nor do they show any effects of fire action. They may have cache pits but there doesn't seem to be any reason for the wattle work in them. The wall post were vertical and showed no effect of strain or stress. The floor was very indefinite and vague except at the center were the burnt area gave the true level. [Feature 17] This large circular structure is delineated by a post mold pattern - no wall trench found nor any evidence that there had been one. Internally the main feature is a small burnt area on the floor close to the center. Three clay lined cache pits found. Two of them rectangular and the other circular. Pit 1 is about .4' deep, 5.6' long and 1 to 2' wide. Pit 2 is ca. .2' deep, 2.3' long and 1' wide. Pit 3 is circular with a diameter of 2.2' and a depth of 3'.</wpa:narrative>
