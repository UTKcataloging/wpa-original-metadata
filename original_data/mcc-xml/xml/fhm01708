  <wpa:narrative>This pile of rock was placed over a group of disarticulated burials lying on the original land surface. These rocks seem to have been rather carelessly piled over this area and then to have been covered with earth to form a low mound. Much of the pile was of rather uncertain boundary due to the additional use of rock in the earth fill of the mound. These rocks averaged the size of a man's fist, although many were twice as large.</wpa:narrative>
