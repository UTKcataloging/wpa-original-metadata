  <wpa:narrative>The site is situated in a field which has been several times plowed over a period of 50 or more years. The hardpan is, in general, a heavy red clay, but occasionally sandy areas were encountered. The site, a flat-topped hill, rising approximately 135 feet above the Clinch River, is almost entirely encompassed by a northward flexed meander of the Clinch. In the apex of the meander lies Buck Island, to the east of the site about 1/4 miles is a deep cut valley in which there is an intermittent stream. Outcrops of chert and flint in Knox dolomite are found not two miles from the site. The soil averaged 20" in depth over the entire site. The soil has been washed from the apex of hill leaving a covering not over 6" deep. On the east in the small drainage valley the soil is often 3' deep, containing much midden material. Photo 11-213 shows the method of advancing the trench, which was everywhere cut down to the hardpan.</wpa:narrative>
