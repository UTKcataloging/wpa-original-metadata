  <wpa:narrative>House number 4. [Feature 4] This structure is identifiable only by a rather irregular post mold pattern around a central fire basin. Little or no information was available on the fire basin since a test pit sunk through it, leaving only one edge for reconstruction purposes. Since there was no evidence of burning there was no evidence concerning the superstructure. In many respects this dwelling is the same as those found on the Yarnell site.</wpa:narrative>
