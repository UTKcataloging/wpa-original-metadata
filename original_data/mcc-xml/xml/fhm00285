  <wpa:narrative>Posts are shown at level at which they appeared. Fire basin in square post-mold outline. A small fire-reddened cupped area with two pieces of charcoal in it, probably representing a small hole used as a fire place, is the patch to the south. The patch of burned soil to the north is a level area very unevenly burned. Traces of burned soil extended in a wide area around these two to an extent of about 3.0 to 4.0 feet. At the base of level 3, about 1.0' below the top of the fire basin, a square post-mold pattern was discovered. In the intervening soil no postmolds or any other structural evidence was discovered. On straight sided pit, oblong in shape was near the fire pit, it was about 2.5 deep. It was not discovered until the lower level was reached. Because the post molds form a symmetrical pattern around the basin, it is assumed that they and the pits within the pattern are associated with the basin.</wpa:narrative>
