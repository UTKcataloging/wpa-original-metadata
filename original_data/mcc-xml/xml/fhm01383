  <wpa:narrative>Feature 2 is an almost square (18' x 20') semi-subterranean house with rounded corners. It was impossible to trace the outline of the pit with the exception of square 12R3 where a faint trace was found. The edge of this outline was cut away and found to be very smooth and to slope inward to the floor. The fill was unusually black and contained a large quantity of pot sherds and numerous artifacts. A number of post molds were found and were very irregularly located, with the exception of a row just inside of the above mentioned outline and continuing in what is presumably the outline of the house (See large ground plan). One midden pit was found. It was fairly circular and had sloping walls with a flat bottom and was filled with a large quantity of ash. Several small stones were found on the floor but they were not worked and were probably located there accidentally. No evidence of wattle was found, and there were no entrance trenches located. The floor was very uneven and appears to be higher in the vicinity of the fire basin and had one extremely low place in the northern end of the house. One centrally located firebasin was found. It is nearly circular with slightly sloping walls, almost vertical, and was .6 in depth. It was entirely filled with ash - no charcoal being evident. The bottom was baked very hard in the southern half, the northern half is quite reddish and appears to have been put in at a later period. The bottom was burned to a depth of .2 and the side to a depth of .3. A fairly good portion of burned floor was located around the fire basin. </wpa:narrative>
