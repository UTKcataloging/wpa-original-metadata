  <wpa:narrative>[Feature 11 is associated with Feature 13]. [Feature 13]On the floor of the structure are considerable patches of cane matting, although none definite enough to see an interlacing pattern. Above the cane is a number of charred logs of the superstructure, one or two at the southeast corner line up with post holes and give the impression that they are fallen posts. In the center of the structure is a puddled clay fire basin, the rim of which is level with the floor. As in the case of Feature 8, there are a number of stones on the floor. An interlacing condition was found in the wattle work which showed a very definite woven pattern of the split cane on the walls. [Feature 11] This burned area overlies a burnt structure and shows the greatest concentration at the north end, particularly a the northwest corner. The burnt clay in the central area was largely wattle work.</wpa:narrative>
