  <wpa:narrative>[Feature 14] Floor built on sand raised four feet above hardpan. Features 11, 12 and 13 are associated with this floor. Floor consisted of hard packed clay. The east side of floor was lost due to erosion which prevented the location of the post molds on the east wall. At the southwest corner of the structure a ramp ran from the original humus to the structure floor level. This would seem to indicate that at the time of occupation the floor was at a higher level than the surrounding village site. Post molds average eight inches in diameter, and are spaced on an average of eighteen inches. [Feature 21] Clay floor containing five fire pits and partial outline of small structure. On excavated portion five fire basins were found, (F.16, F.17, F.18, F.19, and F.20). Burnt grass and cane were present on floor. Very little pottery was found between this floor and that of structure 1. Floor was an average of 2 1/2' above hardpan and had been raised upon sand.</wpa:narrative>
