  <wpa:narrative>The dark line in subsoil has the appearance of an irregular wall trench, it averages .5 - .7 feet in depth and .7 - .8 in width. The post holes average the same or less. Probably the "trench" is but the mark left of rotted posts placed closely together. Both the post holes and the trench are most irregular. It can only be a sort of stockade, or palisade. It has died out at both ends. The feature was recorded only on the 1 to 5 plat (groundplan), plat 2 runs from Ca stakes 51R3 to 42L2.</wpa:narrative>
