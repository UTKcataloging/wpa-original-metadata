  <wpa:narrative>Pit-like refuse deposit. Contained sherds, burned clay, mussel shell, animal bones, charcoal fragments and broken stream pebbles. Deeper deposit of thick midden layer. The distinguishing factor in the type of soil in this feature as in Features 2 and 4 seems to rest upon the probability that there was a heavy deposit of organic material in the area which has decayed and yielded greater quantities of humic acids than the same reaction yielded in the old humus layer. In many respects this feature represents an old filled in gulley.</wpa:narrative>
  <wpa:comments>No record on file for this photograph. However, a record is available for Feature 5. Observer illustrations associated with this feature on file at the institution.</wpa:comments>
