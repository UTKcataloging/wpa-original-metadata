  <wpa:narrative>This crematory basin was dug into subsoil for a depth of over 1'. A slight raised curb carried the top of the basin into Phase A fill, however, this fill earth was a later addition, hence the basin preceded it. The pit originally had been lined with puddled clay, however, it could not be determined whether any firing had been done previous to the cremation. Apparently the body was laid on the bottom of the pit and an intense fire built around it which gave almost complete cremation, leaving only a suggestion of bone. Again there is evidence of earth having been thrown into the pit before the fire was out forming much charcoal and a heavy layer of burnt earth. </wpa:narrative>
