  <wpa:narrative>Semi-subterranean structure with central fire basin with only SW countersink intact, though slight indication of countersink at SE side. Countersink walls vertical where they could be traced. At NW side there is a small countersink outside main pit of Feature 48. This seems to be later than Feature 48. Wattle overlay floor and seemed to be mixed at top with wattle of Feature 39. Lower part of wattle was not burned and I believe this indicates Feature 48 was not burned. There seemed to be some oxidized remains of organic material under wattle, on floor; though it was so badly decomposed its exact nature could not be determined, I assumed it was thatch. Firebasin was very rectangular in shape with vertical walls and flat bottoms meeting abruptly without curve. Bottom was burned 0.2' deep and was cut by a large post hole. Basin was filled with mixed earth and unburned wattle. There was no curb. None of the floor was baked hard, though it all had a fairly good cleavage. Near SW edge lay one large pile of stones and several scattered stones. No entrance trench could be associated with the feature. F.S. specimens catalogued as Feature 48 came from lower levels and from SW part of the area covered by Features 39, 48, and 51 as exact separation could not be accomplished until structure was ground planned. It was necessary to work full crew on these structures and possibly some of the material catalogued as Feature 39 may belong with Feature 48. This structure from its size seems to be simply a residence structure.</wpa:narrative>
