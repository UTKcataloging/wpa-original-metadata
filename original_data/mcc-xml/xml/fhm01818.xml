  <wpa:narrative>This large structure may have been a chunkee yard as two discoidals were found within its boundaries. The soil covering this area was about 14" deep and the whole floor surface was doubtlessly destroyed by cultivation. The SW corner was deeply eroded and all molds removed. Hardpan was a heavy, red, clay. Most of the molds were 6-8 inches deep. Photos 11-333 and 11-334 show the NW corner of the structure; photo 11-330 shows the SE border.</wpa:narrative>
