  <wpa:narrative>[Feature 13] Sandy, fire-discolored floor just under the plow line on top of the mound and post mold patterns of a structure. This feature was incomplete inasmuch as the plow had apparently destroyed the west side. The excavation of it was hampered by excessive cold and frost so that we had difficulty getting what data we have. [Feature 17] Plow disturbed square clay fireplace or altar. Plow had eradicated almost all this feature. When cut away the hard floor of feature 13 was seen to run uninterrupted beneath. Was obviously an addition upon the floor of Feature 13. [Feature 18] (No narrative). [Feature 19] Only a fragment of this feature was found. The portion remaining seemed to be the remnant of a more or less square raised platform. Was touching east wall of Feature 13. Floor of Feature 13 ran unbroken beneath this feature.</wpa:narrative>
  <wpa:comments>There are four feature data forms pertaining to this one photograph, detailing the different features seen. Observer illustrations are on file at the institution.</wpa:comments>
