  <wpa:narrative>This layer appears only on the south bank of the trench. It so happens that this trench is the limiting one of the staked mound. To investigate this layer more adequately would require adding 10' or more to the southern limits of the mouned. This burned layer appears to be an old floor or roof made of bark or wood that had had clay over it. The clay was fired, either by the burning of the structure or by having a fire built over it and then swept clean. Another possibility is that this is an indication of a burial pit made as follows: A pit has been dug and the floor sprinkled with sand. Over this bark was laid flat and upright on the side on the sides. Over this more vertical and horizontal sections of bark. Burial four and seven were under this burned layer.</wpa:narrative>
