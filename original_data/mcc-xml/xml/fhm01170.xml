  <wpa:narrative>The latter were indicated by burnt areas upon the floor in the positions indicated by the elevated postions of the floor which appear in the photograph. The north half of the floor was cut down to basic clay in an effort to locate the wall pattern. The north half was cut down to basic clay leaving the wall trenches standing. Rectangular structure. Partitions composed of double rows of posts, one row distinctly slanted, other straight. Horizontal mold between rows of posts and at base (outside vertical row). Slanting row porbably to reinforce straight row. Two small burned areas adjacent to partitions are probably fireplaces though there is no basin in either. Northern half was confused by trees, etc and it was necessary to cut away to basic clay to find trenches, post molds, etc. Structure was built above old humus - humus was cleared thn filled in with 0.2' - 0.6' of pure yellow clay and leveled, then 0.3' of mottled humus and clay was spread over. The upper surface of this formed the floor. No evidence of wattle. Some thatch appeared in trenches.</wpa:narrative>
