  <wpa:narrative>This house was first found when the fire basin was located. The top section of the basin was missing and probably was a little higher originally. The level found was about the top of Stratum II. The house is undoubtedly a late Mississippi pit house intrusive from that occupational level, which in this particular area would be plow line. No house pit outline was seen for this house, however. The house is delineated by post molds forming a rectangular pattern. This house worked itself out very definitely on the composite ground plan by the consistent plotting of so-called miscellaneous molds. The central fire basin was circular with sides sloping to a flat bottom in central section. The top of this basin was damaged, probably 0.2' or so being cut away. It was intrusive to a burial on the northwest side. </wpa:narrative>
