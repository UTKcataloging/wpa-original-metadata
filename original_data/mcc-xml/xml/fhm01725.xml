  <wpa:narrative>[30SW42] As in many of their burials, the limestone slabs show water wear. This came from an exposed surface. [30SW41] SW wall of cist is formed by a wall of the adjacent burial 30SW42. 30SW41 is higher than 30SW42, evidently built later than30SW42. [30SW38] Looted, leg bones left in place. [30SW32] Either a "bundle" burial or a collection of bones removed, probably contemporaneously to burials from either of the two adjacent graves (which have been disturbed by modern looters). [30SW18] Modern looting, walls of burial situation not yet clear. [30SW75] Little could be said about this burial, since it was too badly scattered. In general, the impression was gained that deposition was extended, with skull, though no skull was found. [30SW74] This burial was either disturbed (by rodents, etc.) or else was partly dismembered at time of interment. The right radius was lying across the pelvis and was propped against the side wall. Note that the SW side wall lacked a slab making it complete. [30SW37] No remarks. [30SW76A] - 30SW76 A and B are a single bundle burial consisting of 2 skulls and a humerus cradled on a pair of femora. A few toe bones lay on top of 30SW76A. Skull, clavicle, and a few fragments of rib, and toe bones lay in a heap just north of the bundle. A fragment of innominate bones lay on 30SW76B skull. Note in completeness of cist. Floor slabs were present. [30SW35] No remarks. [30SW17] Modern looting. [30SW16] Modern looting, no bones saved. [30SW39] No remarks. [30SW70] No remarks.</wpa:narrative>
