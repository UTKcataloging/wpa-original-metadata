  <wpa:narrative>The trench in this picture is at -5.8 DD. It is of dark yellow clay in a gray clay. It shows up well. A trench of an antecedent structure cuts across in the foreground. This feature has a fine, hard floor. The fallen daub and this floor both lie mostly in the Northern and Western halves of the structure. The rest was, of course, destroyed by the plow. There is a large, irregular pit around stake 69R7 which was dug by farmer Wynn in search of his pots.</wpa:narrative>
