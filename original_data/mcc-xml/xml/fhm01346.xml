  <wpa:narrative>Owing to depth of erosion and plowing in this area nothing but the lower portions of the post molds and fire pit remain. Chunks of burned clay in the fire pit were probably sections of the rim which were broken over into the interior of the pit. No floor areas remained, however, there was a slight accumulation (about 0.3' thick) of humic silt over the fire basin which intervened between the top of the fire pit and the bottom of the plow zone. I suspect that this deposition was either recent and that some damage had been done to the top of the fire pit before this protecting accumulation washed in. It is impossible to tell whether Feature 3 preceded or was intrusive to Feature 5. Some of the post molds for Feature 3 are noticeably deeper than those for Feature 5 in this section which might suggest precedence for Feature 3. Not sufficient reliable evidence to support this idea. Feature 5 nearly bisects Feature 3 from NE to SW.</wpa:narrative>
