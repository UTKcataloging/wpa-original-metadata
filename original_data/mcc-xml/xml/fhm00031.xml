  <wpa:narrative>This mound was built over humus which was mixed with much evidence of former occupation. There were many potsherds, shells, etc., throughout the humus. Above this the mound was built of clay without showing a hard packed floor over the humus. Seventeen inches above the humus was a hard packed sand floor. On this floor was a square altar. There were very few evidences in form of pottery or artifacts throughout the mound earth. One intrusive burial located in the mound accompanied with 2 whole pottery vessels. Beneath the mound in the southeast corner was a small structure, dug 10 inches into the hardpan, apparently showing occupation before mound was built. This structure had a circular fire pit.</wpa:narrative>
