  <wpa:narrative>This structure lies under Feature 35 and farther East. It is of interest because it is the first dwelling found on this section of the Mound. It is square, delineated by post molds set in wall molds. Centrally located is a circular fire basin on a raised platform Ca. 2' square, of burned clay and 0.2' above the floor. The basin is 1.3' in diameter and 0.5' deep. The floor is of hard packed sandy clay and very irregular. This was the first structure built on Level D. The posts were set vertically in wall trenches and showed no evidence of superstructure stresses. The wall molds were filled with earth and showed no evidence of having had horizontal support logs placed in them. No corner posts were used.</wpa:narrative>
