  <wpa:narrative>Area of disturbance at base of plow line. Contained dark disturbed soil, charcoal, stone, mussel shell and animal bone fragments. Part of this feature extended into the south wall of the trench into an area which was not excavated - thus in the above measurements the maximum width appears greather than the maximum length. (See ground plan).</wpa:narrative>
