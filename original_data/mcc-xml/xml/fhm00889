  <wpa:narrative>[Feature 72] The fill for the altar consists of fine gray sand an average .5' - .6' thick. The exterior was plastered with clay subsequently burned. The central pit was jug-shaped about .9' deep. The upper part contained one or two sherds and a quantity of mussel shells. The lower part contained a large quantity of fragmentary charcoal and ash cemented and packed in the pit by heat and pressure. [Feature 73] Rectangular, large post structure on Floor P level. This structure was erected of large posts in a rectangular almost square pattern. The posts average about 3.0' apart. A small quantity of charred thatch, cane and some wood lay on the floor over the postmolds in the ESE corner and to the outside of the structure. the trench for the postmolds of Feature 63 were dug from the level of Feature 73 (Floor P), the posts set and the fill between the two floors of feature 63 and 73 added. This structure is radically different from the others encountered in the mound. However, the central square altar is a familiar feature.</wpa:narrative>
