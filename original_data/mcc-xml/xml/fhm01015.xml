  <wpa:narrative>This structure has as yet been the only one which possessed a clearly defined pit. It appeared on the horizontal face as high in the deposit as level III but was invisible in the vertical profile above this plane. In this level it possessed but a faint outline and it was necessary to remove all the humus-stained subsoil before the outline was distinguishable. This fill of the pit may have at one time been midden material that had been amalgamated by time, for at the present time it appeared to be a humus-filled sandy loam with some light admixture of clay.</wpa:narrative>
