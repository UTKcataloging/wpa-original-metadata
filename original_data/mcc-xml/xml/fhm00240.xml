  <wpa:narrative>This hearth occurred on the floor of Feature 28. House structure. Except that no trenched entrance could be determined this structure is more or less identical with the other house types found at this site. In all probability the interior or floor of the house was sunk below the level of the surrounding ground level - no pit outlines could be discerned because of the proximity of the plow zone - streaks left by the plow share were clearly visible at the margins of the structure. The center of the structure was low enough to escape such disturbance and retained a small amount of black organic fill over a burned clay floor. The dotted line on the ground plan represents a ledge left in excavation - the workmen cutting deeper than desirable along the eastern edges of the structure before any structural indications were evident.</wpa:narrative>
