  <wpa:narrative>[Feature 43A] This platform is made of hard packed sandy clay smoothed and burned deep red on the surface. It is similar to the other platforms described, being 6.5' long, 3.5' wide and 1.1' high. The sides slope outward slightly so that the circumferance at the base is somewhat greater than at the top. The platform rests on Feature 43 floor and is in a direct East-West center axis with the two cache pits and fire basin. It is located Ca. 5' East of the West wall of this structure and the area in back of it is roughly divided into small compartments by internal post molds. Feature 40 didn't lay on this feature but came up to the West edge. [Feature 43] This structure is rectangular in shape and is delineated by deep rather evenly spaced post molds. A fairly hard, well made floor of packed sandy clay burnt dull red in many areas runs directly to the post molds, leaving no sign of a wall trench. However, on the inside of the post molds and just below the floor is a log mold. On the floor are a number of misc. post molds most of which are a the western end back of the platform 43A. Roughly these divide this section into small compartments. The subfeatures on the floor are independently described. This location is shown on the plat for this structure. The platform, two pits and fire basin are all on an east-west central axis through the structure. Feature 40B encircled this structure lying heavily over certain sections of the post mold pattern, while over the entire floor, thin in the central sections and much thicker toward the wall was a mass of clay that in all likelihood fell from the roof. From this evidence it becomes evident that this structure was an earth lodge in all essential respect similar in form (see Feature 41 form) to Feature 41. There is practically no burnt material on the floor of this structure -- just a little piece of thatch at the southwest corner. The log mold on the inside of the post mold pattern in ca 6' deep but ranges from .3' to .9'. The effect is exactly what one would expect if the small ends of saplings were doubled over the end of another sapling where two were laid together, end to end. This, of course, was necessary because it would have been very difficult to have found single saplings long enough to have reached the length of the wall. These log molds were found only on the north and south walls and were not present for the east and west walls. Further no log mold was bound at the bottom of the post molds on the opposite side; however molds were set in a wall trench. </wpa:narrative>
