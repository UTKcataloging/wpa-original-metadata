  <wpa:narrative>In square 10.6. Pit 1.4' deep 1.4' in diameter. Unusual in that it had a clay cellar 3" above floor level. The post mold outline of this structure on account of the great profusion of post molds could not be determined with accuracy. The accompanying diagram shows two possible solutions for the problem presented by the post mold arrangement. The diagram of this structure should be carefully compared with the diagram of the secondary structure, Feature #40. The holes in red on the accompanying diagram appeared to be double, i.e., a larger hole, with a smaller hole inside. There was a definite soil demarkation in these double holes. Also there was a marked difference in hardness of the two colors of soil. The molds indicated in brown on the diagram may possibly be the northern end of the primary structure. If this is true it would allow a complete secondary structure. The first figures given in the dimensions are those for the larger structure, the second for the smaller structure.</wpa:narrative>
