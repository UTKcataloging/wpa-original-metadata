  <wpa:narrative>The mounds were partially covered by small trees, but consisted of bare rock slabs with little included soil. They were between 16' and 18' in diameter and piled to a height of 2', though possible were greater at some former time. According to local reports, three of the mounds were excavated in 1900 by several mining engineers. The looting was obvious and nearly all artifacts were associated with Burial 1, in Mound 2. Mounds located on summit of high hill overlooking river. Mound 1; photo 18-347. Mound 2; photo 18-348. Mound 3; photo 18-349. Mound 4; photo 18-350.</wpa:narrative>
