  <wpa:narrative>This burial was deposited in what appeared to be a pit sunk through the shell layer, St. I-A, just beyond the edge of what seems to be the sloping edge of the sand mound. The only evidence of a pit was around the burial on the level on which it was deposited. There was a layer of small stone, and charred material at the bottom of St. I-A, but this had been cut through , apparently by a pit, so that this stone did not extend up to the bone. A layer of flat limestone slabs, among which was one flat piece of shale showing iron content, overlaid the burial. These had shifted slightly. This burial, no doubt, was intrusive from above St. I-A and associates with the Mississippi component.</wpa:narrative>
