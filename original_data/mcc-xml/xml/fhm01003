  <wpa:narrative>[Feature 15] On the north end of the site, where the outline of the site runs into the roadway, in the extensive depression in subsoil designated as Feature 10 a large amount of charcoal and other charred material was encountered over an area about 20' x 20' in Level 2. Burnt thatch, burnt cane, burnt poles from 0.3' to 0.05' in diameter and a few burnt briquettes were distinguishable. [Feature 24] This structure consisted only of a rectangular postmold and trench pattern. It repeats the general house type of the site, Type 1. Posts and interstices and trenches are all similar to other houses. [Feature 25] This small structure was adjacent to and precedent to the outermost structure of Feat. 19. It is smaller than the average structures but otherwise has characteristic small postmolds evenly placed in narrow open-cornered trenches. [Feature 19] This series of structures consists of six and a half parallel trenches on the West side, 4 parallel trenches on the East side, and 5 parallel and two diagonal trenches on the North side. From these, three whole patterns can be formed and one partial pattern. This leaves several trenches with no apparent place in a structure. All the patterns are similar in that they are all open-cornered, all have the common small postmold set in the ordinary regularity. [Feature 19A] This structure is the largest of the series making up feature 19. It is open-cornered, has narrow trenches, small (0.2' - 0.3' diameter) postmolds, even (0.4') interstices, Type I. [Feature 19B] This is a Type I structure -- open-cornered wall trenches, small post molds, even interstices. [Feature 19C] This is the third largest of the five patterns of Feature 19. It is a type I structure -- small postmolds, even interstices and open corners. [Feature 19D] This structure is next to the smallest. Except for size it is similar to all the others. [Feature 19E] This is the innermost and smallest of the five structures. It repeats the type encountered before except in size. [Feature 22] This structure is characteristic of the Type 1 structure of this site with a single exception. These trenches were joined at the corners instead of being ...open at the corners. However, it is not a case of a continuous trench, but rather the straight wall trenches were joined by a small diagonal trench which contained one or two posts. [Feature 23] There were two fire basins located within the trench pattern which ...associate with the wall trenches. These basins are atypical of the basins found on this site heretofore, in that the sides are convex and appear to have been very carefully molded. The bottom in perfectly flat. [Feature 26] There are here two superimposed structures. Each resembles the other in all characteristics except size, size being the chief difference in all these structures. Postmolds, trenches, etc., place these two structures into Type 1. [Feature 27] This structure lay beneath a heavy black humic deposit. However, we were unable to locate in this deposit any floor or fire basin. The trench pattern has three open corners and one closed corner. Otherwise it has all characteristics typical of most of the structures on the site. [Feature 20] This situation was very complicated, many of the trenches crossing each other, others running into single channels. Only evidence for chronological order lies in relative depth of trenches and in determination of precedence through markings showing in the fills. Average postmold diameter ca. 0.3'. Average interstices ca. 0.5'. Interstices not uniform.</wpa:narrative>
