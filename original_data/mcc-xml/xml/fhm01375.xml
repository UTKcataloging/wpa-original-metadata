  <wpa:narrative>[Feature 5] Post mold pattern fairly good. No evidence of pit. Plow had cut away upper part of basin and any floor that did exist. Walls of basin vertical, floor flat, built of hard baked puddle clay burned 0.2' d. Two post holes had unburned pine posts. One saved as DS [dendrosample] 3. This structure was so badly plowed away little could be learned about it. No evidence of floor. Interrelation of Feature 5 and 6 not clear but Feature 6 is slightly higher. [Feature 6] Firebasin seems to indicate a house a little higher than Feature 5 but badly disturbed by plow. Firebasin mostly plowed away, walls vertical, floor flat, built of puddled clay burned 0.1'. No evidence of wattle. Near NW side a small pit with partly flexed child. As floor level is missing whether or not this is inclusive cannot be determined, but is inside area of house.</wpa:narrative>
