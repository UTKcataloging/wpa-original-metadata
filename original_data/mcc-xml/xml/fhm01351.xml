  <wpa:narrative>No entryway discernible - the floor pattern is a roughly rectangular mass of post molds about the fire basin - a central mass of fragmentary wattle covered the fire basin and floor - rim of fire basin about 0.3' above floor. Floor not burned, but compacted and mottled with black disturbed soil. Three shallow pits and two large post molds or pits in interior of house. One pit adjacent to fire basin. Post molds range from 0.4' to 2.5' in depth. Several areas much disturbed by roots - making individual post molds difficult to distinguish. It is impossible to identify either from the house itself or from the ground plan all of the peripheral post molds which are definitely associated with the structure. In cutting out the fire basin it was shown definitely that there had been two fire basins - apparently the original was rimless and made of modelled clay - circular shape.Subsequently loose fill was thrown in on the lower basin and a second thick layer of clay heavily tempered (grass) rim. The fill between the two basins is 0.1" thick. The false bottom in the east half of the pit is the bottom of the upper basin. The floor surfaces of the basin tend to merge high on the sides of the basins. Lower basin has an extension or platform to south at level of floor.
