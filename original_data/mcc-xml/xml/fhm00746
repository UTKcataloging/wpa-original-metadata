  <wpa:narrative>Depth of ash pit was .6'; the size of the hearth was 2.3' in length. Both rim and pit were surfaced with puddled clay and burned to a brick-red color. [Feature 19] The structure is about 15" square and delineated by fairly large post molds rather irregularly spaced and comparatively far apart. The corners are rounded. Over the floor lies the charred remains of cane and one or two small pieces of logs indicated the house had been destroyed by fire. In the center is the best example of a fire basin yet found on the site. The outside periphery is square while inside it is circular. It is raised above the floor .4'. The rim is .5' thick. The inside diameter is 1.3' and the outside diamter is 2.3'. It has a depth of .5'.</wpa:narrative>
