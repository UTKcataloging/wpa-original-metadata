  <dc:title>287MG31 Hiwassee Island Site 42MG31, Meigs Co., TN. 42MG31 - Earth mound. 5-line profile. Picture shows mound Phases A and B. Phase A appears as a continuous capping of light brownish yellow humic clay with loads and scattered shell incorporated in its fill. Near the center is a cross section of an 'excavators' pit. Phase B is the darker phase lying under Phase A. There is considerable humic material in its fill. </dc:title>

  <wpa:narrative>The pit of Burial 42MG79 can be seen in the center of the picture [Burial 42MG79] This burial had completely disintegrated except for some barely traceable long bones and one piece of jaw. The disintegrated bone that remained showed a flexed burial and apparently was an adult. There were no artifacts. The pit seemed to originate near the bottom of Phase B, and the 5-line profile, which showed a cross-section view of this pit. It also showed and interesting picture of mound fill settling, with soils from Phase B having dropped completely into the pit. What caused such a great shifting of mound soil is not known since there is no evidence in the pit that might suggest a log tomb or any other phenomena. The pit extended into subsoil for 3.3'.</wpa:narrative>
