  <wpa:narrative>[30SW136] Full top, head and foot stones were all that remained of the cist. No sides or bottom slabs. Feet disturbed, thorax rotted, otherwise in fair shape. [30SW161] Complete top, bottom, sides and end slabs. Sides knocked down. Skull had been dragged down to foot of cist. Thorax disturbed and rotted. See 30SW161A remarks. [30SW161A] This skull probably occupied cist 30SW161 and was thrown out. Seemed to be resting on old land surface. If this is true, the cist of 30SW161 was sunk in the ground. [30SW155] Ft. full top slabs. [30SW162] Complete top, bottom, side and end slabs. 30SW162 is the bottom (extended) skeleton in this cist. The missing skull may be the skull in 30SW162B, a bundle of fragmented long bones and pelvis lying over the lower legs. 30SW162B was a former occupant of the cist. 30SW162A was a child (represented by a fragmentary mandible and long bones). Its chronological postition in the cist is unknown. It may be intrusive to 30SW162.</wpa:narrative>
