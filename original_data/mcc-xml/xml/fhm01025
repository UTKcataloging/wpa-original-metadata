  <wpa:narrative>This feature represents at least five structures, perhaps more. There are five fire basins, differing only slightly in size, almost identical in other respects and covering a vertical distance of about 0.8'. The basins are all circular with sloping sides and rounded bottoms. Four of these are superimposed upon one another, the fifth and deepest is located alone about two feet to the north of these. There are five or more wall patterns, two or three of which are trench and post patterns with small (0.2') posts. There are traces of at least two other patterns made up of larger posts and no trenches. The centers of these patterns are filled with miscellaneous posts to which, because of their number, no function can be assigned. Over the whole area, and attributable to the last structure built is a mass of burnt daub and charcoal. However, even this is virtually valueless because we are unable to distinguish the last strucutre from the first. From this however we did obtain one good photograph of superstructure. The fill in this region was heavy midden deposit which extended down to a level a foot below the tops of the upper fire baisns. It is due to this that the patterns we have are incomplete. The later ones should be, if our assumptions are correct, the patterns of the large posts without the wall trenches.</wpa:narrative>
