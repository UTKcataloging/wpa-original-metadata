  <wpa:narrative>[Feature 1] This structure is delineated by post molds on 3 and part of the 4th side. At the Northeast corner, two charred logs were found in a trench with charred butt ends of posts alongside. These logs had evidently been set in the ground to form a base support for the sapling posts that were used as support for the side walls and may have been bent over to make a dome-shaped roof. These two logs are the only evidence that the structure had burned down. A small fire basin, Feat. 2, was in the center of the structure. [Feature 2] This square structure is outlined by post molds and in some cases parts of posts are still visible in a charred condition. Along the post molds at the N-W corner and at the East end of the South wall are charred logs lying parallel and next to the post molds. ...The posts were small saplings about 3" in diameter. The charred logs that have fallen appear to be from the roof. The evidence for this being the fact that none of the logs orient with the post molds as we would expect that the side wall logs would do. The floor of the structure is burned hard and there is some evidence of sand. [Feature 3] A small fire basin close to the center of the structure with the top being flush with the floor of the structure. The basin presents no unusual features, although only A and B mounds of 8HS1 structures have such a basin among the group of mounds (6-7-8 A and B HS1).</wpa:narrative>
