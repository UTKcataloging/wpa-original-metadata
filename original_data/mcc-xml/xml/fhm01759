  <wpa:narrative>Floor burnt hard in some places and charcoal and cane on floor at south end of mound. Some fragments of pottery scattered on burnt floor and a few small fragments of white burnt bone. On the north side of the mound is a burnt area containing pottery, shells, and many burnt places and ashes. A series of post molds found running in lines north and south and east and west, which seem to be remains of a wooden structure. This structure, when uncovered, was found to measure about 22'6" east to west and 29' north to south. This structure had only a single line of post holes. No ditch was noticed in this structure although there may have been one in it. In the center of the mound on the floor was found a large fire place, with a lot of small fire-cracked stones, postherds, etc. to the north and east, but inside the east line of post holes was found a circular depression in the floor 30" in diameter and 15" deep.</wpa:narrative>
