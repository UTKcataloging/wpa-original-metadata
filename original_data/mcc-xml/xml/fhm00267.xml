  <wpa:narrative> Pit outline is not shown in this photograph. None could be found. It is believed that the south end (the left of this picture) of Feature 29 was cut away. Card with Figure I on it locates the fire basin with post holes intrusive to it. Number 2 locates fire basin which is higher level with a burned floor covering it. The 3 small trenches are exploratory trenches dug in an effort to locate some pit outline. Feature 29 apparently is the remains of several successive structures. About fifteen feet of the south end of the post mold pattern was dug out before the structure became apparent. The postion tha was inadvertently excavated showed up as a detritus filled yellowish sandy soil with islands of undisturbed soil. When this earth was removed a mass of post holes were exposed, but no trace of any floor existed, in fact at no place in this feature other than immedicately adjacent to the fire basins was any floor evident. Several trenches were dug through the house and at the edge of the deposit in an attempt to locate in profile the floor and the outline of the pit. This procedure, however, netted nothing more than locating three post molds in profile and finding that they originated at a level about 0.2' below the top of the fill. The post molds were concentrated at the south end of the house and they progressively diminished in number towards the north end until hardly any appeared at that end. To the north of the feature is the extensive sterile area that extends for about 100 feet. The post mold pattern was very irregular. One post mold, near what was believed to be the west edge of the structure sloped inward toward the fire basins. There were seven fire basins in the structure in a line running NNW and SSE. Assuming that these basins were roughly in the center of the structure, the house would be about 40.0 feet long and about 30.0 feet wide.... All in all this house yielded little positive information although it does present one possibility not before occurring on this site. That is, that it may be that this feature is a location in which several successive houses were built, suggesting that house locations were retained and not casually moved.</wpa:narrative>
