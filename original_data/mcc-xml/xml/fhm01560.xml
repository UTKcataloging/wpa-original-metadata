  <wpa:narrative>No fire basin found. House extends into 43 Line profile. Narrow gap in northeast and southwest walls due to filled-in preliminary test and profile trench between 41.7 and 42 Lines. (Note: the SW corner of structure eroded away during heavy rain before entire pattern was excavated). This is the second case of the use of wall trenches in architecture encountered in this excavation. This house was delineated by wall trenches with molds which give a rounding effect the the corners. The extreme size of this structure rarity of type, and proximity to the mound (3RE12) suggests that it was probably a ceremonial house. Just what relationship it may bear to the mound is, or course, not known at this time. The NW wall was not excavated due to the complexity of the area near the mound. It was deemed advisable to let the rudimentary excavation take care of that area which will provide relationship between the village and the various mound phases. The S corner of this structure was uncovered, but before photographing or ground planning a large section eroded away during a heavy rain, because of the sandy nature of the soil. Three post molds were seen for this corner, however, these outside the trenches, very similar to the SE corner which showed four smaller and shallower molds outside the trenches. The NW corner molds were not all found because the excavation went a little deep and the molds were probably inadvertently cut out. The walls of the house were only slightly irregular in alignment and were characterized by relatively narrow trenches into which were placed the wall posts, pretty regularly spaced, and in most instances extending a 0.1' or 0.2' below the bottom of the trench, this apparently occasioned by "chugging" the wall posts in the trench, which produced a compace crescent band of soil in the bottom of each mold. Although the wall trenches were only slightly wider than the diameters of the molds in many sections, there seemed to be a tendency towards placement of the post against the side of the trench facing outside the house. The basal ends of the molds were slightly rounded in most cases where they were checked in cross section. The wall trenches and post were truly vertical longitudinally, i.e., there was apparently a tendency of the trenches to lean outward at the top and slightly inward at the bottom - (this shown on sketch of house plan). The floor was characterized generally by a midden or accretive floor for most of the area, especially the southern half, showing a burned appearance. Two or three isolatede areas were burned red and were suggestive of a prepared floor but these were probably areas of the loam soil fired red by hot ash. No prepared fire basin was found, but one of the roughly circular burned areas with some ash lying on top was found that centered more in the structure and may have been the remains of a fire place which had been badly damaged by intrusion. No evidence on the superstructure was found except a small area of charred cane matting and saplings which were not informative. Four large interior molds which seem to be associated as roof support molds were found. These were filled with charred material in the upper sections. This house was early in the Mississippi deposit and rested on the bottom of the deposit, possibly on the humus under the village. An attempt was made to isolate material as "fill above" and material below the floor, but it is not known just how reliable this separation has been, due to the fact that the floor was found not to be on an even plane in a NW-SW direction, it being about 0.3' higher on the NW end than on the SE end. It is believed the material associated as "above" and "below" this floor in Sqs. 40L4, 40L3, and 40L4 can be taken as fairly good areas. Sqs. 41L4, 41L3, and 41L2 are somewhat dubious. The sqs. N. of these, it is believed, are not good, as the floor level was found to lie higher than the level designated for the feature floor at the time the separation was made. The break in the walls in the N section is due to the preliminary 3' trenches previously dug for stratigraphic purposes.</wpa:narrative>
