  <wpa:narrative>Fire basin, burnt soil and associated evidence of a dwelling. Note pit in background left. This feature consists of a squarish fire basin, an area of burnt soil and a heap of burnt soil which has bits of baked mud in it that are clearly fragments of daubing. An exhaustive search located no postmolds. The fire basin is poorly made, roughly square in shape and has an uneven and not wholly burnt bottom. The sides are thinly burnt. The depth of the basin was about 0.2'. The basin was filled with clayey soil at top and ash and charcoal at the bottom.</wpa:narrative>
