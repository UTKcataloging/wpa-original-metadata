  <wpa:narrative>This ramp is entirely similar to the two directly above it although somewhat better made. It has an angle of inclination of ca. 45 degrees against the mound side slope which is ca. 80 degrees. The top surface has been cut so that there are 8 very definite steps from top to bottom. The ramp is made of consolidated sandy clay but showed no evidence of burning. Ramp is laid up against the South side slope of level F near the eastern end.</wpa:narrative>
