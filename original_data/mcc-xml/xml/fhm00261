  <wpa:narrative>This feature was as area of reddened clay, undoubtedly an area upon which had burned a rather intensive fire. There were post holes and pits intrusive to the area and about ash lay over the rest from about 0.1' deep to move. This feature probably is associated to the extensive Feature 21B which is the same thing and is about 3 feet away. It seems to have a definite relationship to the occupation, but apparently has no significance other than being a fire place. (See Features 21A and 21B).</wpa:narrative>
