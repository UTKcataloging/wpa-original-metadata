  <wpa:narrative>Block in center background contains burial intrusive from floor G above. Intrusive burial pit in left background. Two floor layers about 1.0' apart were associated with the same wooden superstructure. The upper floor L1 had been built over the L2 floor. The exterior horizontal molds, except where such did not occur along the NW wall of the structure, were laid in the bottom of the trench which originated at the L2 level. The interior horizontal molds (except along NW side) were laid in on the L2 level probably before the intervening fill between the two floors was added. The floors were each about 0.1' thick of mixed sand and clay packed to concrete-like hardness. The vertical postmolds averaged about 0.3' in diameter and 1.2' to 2.0' in depth. All had a definite slant toward the center of the structure. The five northernmost post molds in the NE wall had been obliterated by an intrusive burial pit - only the bottoms showed after the burial had been removed. Absolutely no corner posts could be found despite speical attention and checking both horizontally and vertically.</wpa:narrative>
