  <wpa:narrative>[Feature 63] This structure has only been partially excavated due to the limits of mound excavation. The posts are set in wall trenches which are open at the corners. However, corner posts closed the corners. No very definite floor was found except around the fire basin. This basin was circular, 1' in diameter and 0.3' deep. The top was level with the floor. The basin was made of sandy clay puddled into a slight hole in the floor. This structure is actually a village structure and does not properly belong to level G Mound Phase but was peripheral to it. It is on a considerably higher level than Feature 61 and about the same as Feature 62 and hence it can be said to have been in use during the time of Level G after Feature 61 had fallen into disuse. [Feature 64] This structure is the last of three that had been built in this area. While this area is under Mound 37MG31, it is nevertheless part of a village site surrounding Level G Mound Phase. Only the south half of the structure has been excavated due to the enormous mass of earth that would have to be moved to complete it. The structure is rectangular with vertical posts set in wall trenches. The trenches were open at the corners, but a single post mold closed this gap. The fire basin was roughly central in location. This basin is 0.8' in diameter, 0.4' deep and poorly made of sandy clay puddled into a depression on the floor. The top was level with the floor. The floor was rather indefinite although around the fire basin it was slightly burnt. In other areas there was evidence of hard packing; this was especially true around the southeast corner, where a considerable patch of clay had been placed to build up the floor. [Feature 65] This structure was the second of a series of three built one over the other. Only the south half was excavated due to the enormous mass of earth that would have had to have been moved to complete the structure. In form, this dwelling is rectangular. It was built of posts set vertically in wall trenches. These trenches were open at the corners but they were closed by a corner post. Near the center was a small square fire basin 1' wide and 0.3' deep. It was made of puddled sandy clay, fire-brick red. The top was level with the floor. The floor of Feature 64 seemed to continue across this basin, but the evidence was fragmentary. The floor of the structure was very indefinite except around the fire basin where it was somewhat burnt. [Feature 66] This is the first of three structures built in this area and only a section of two walls and a corner were excavated. The walls are made up of posts set vertically in wall trenches. Due to disturbance from the above structure, the actual corner could not be determined. Excavation had not gone far enough to locate a fire basin, however, a circular raised area surrounded by post molds and resting on the floor was found. This was raised ca. 0.2' above the floor and may have been higher but the above structure destroyed it. The floor was of hard packed yellow sandy clay.</wpa:narrative>
