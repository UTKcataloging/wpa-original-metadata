  <wpa:narrative> Possibly some part of pit house. This is tromeled at plowline. -4.6 DD. St. I. A most unusual business. First noted as a large, oval, dark midden patch near the edge of the bluff it was staked and the plow removed. The square midden filled pit in the yellow clay S.S. then showed -- see 1st photo. This was removed by careful troweling in .25' to .3' levels. The 1st level removed was the most interesting. Here a regular arrangement of charred poles and scraps of interwoven cane and small pole roof or wall were exposed. On piece of this was photographed (249BN8) and one removed as F.S. (17) or Dendro 8. The second level removed most of the charred poles etc. and exposed the insloping sides of the pit and the large mixed ash and burned earth area in the center. The third level removed all of the midden and exposed the clay at the bottom of the pit. No post holes were found within or outlining the pit that gave any idea as to it's construction -- although the usual large number of miscellaneous were present in the whole excavated area. A further search for more of these pits as shown by my spreading excavation along the bluff front, failed. Judging from the remains I should say that a light and impermanent cane and brush shelter had been erected over the small pit. This pit partly filled with midden, probably from living and then the structure seems to have burned and collapsed. After this the pit was completely filled to the general level. It seems to me that this structure, other than the pit, was wholly superficial. That is, there were no posts or poles embedded in the earth to form the framework of the structure. Probably this sort of shelter, something like the brush wick-i-up of the Ojibwa etc. was used as an impermanent camp house by the inhabitants of the site or as a home by poorer members of the group.</wpa:narrative>
