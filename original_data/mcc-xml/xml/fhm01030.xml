  <wpa:narrative>[Feature 13] Feature 13 is the third cemetery to have been discovered at 7HY5. It has, as yet, been barely touched. It covers, so far, the squares from L24 to L21 inclusive and on the 42 line and 43 line. Twenty-one burials were removed. ... This seemed to be wholly a late or "Mississippian" cemetery. A broken shell, a water bottle, some shell beads, and two gorgets were the only artifacts of importance found within the burials.</wpa:narrative>
