  <wpa:narrative>Palisade trench, about 1.1' deep and 0.9' wide average, depth varied due to erosion and was apparently dug in sections, there being occasional "partitions" across it. Posts apparently set in trench and tamped with earth as no post holes regularly appear in bottom of pit. Those which do occur are probably intrusive to the pit. Follows present edge of bench.</wpa:narrative>
