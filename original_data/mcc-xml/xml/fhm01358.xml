  <wpa:narrative>Countersink, traced only on SE and NW sides, was somewhat irregular and walls nearly vertical. House was partly destroyed by plow in east half. Floor showed plow marks and SE and NE sides plowed away. Post mold pattern completely traced. Floor baked hard and few pieces of wattle lay on it. Firebasin top plowed away, walls vertical, floor flat, of hard baked puddled clay. Bottom of basin burned 0.25' deep. Floor somewhat uneven. Just north of entrance were two very large, unmodified boulders and small cracked stones embedded in floor. Entrance at south corner consisted of two shallow external trenches and deeper internal trench. At north corner was a large stump hole. In two interior post molds were cases of pine posts - dendrochronology specimen numbers 1 and 2.</wpa:narrative>
