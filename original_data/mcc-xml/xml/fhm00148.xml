  <wpa:narrative>Two closed wall trenches post mold patterns. Feature 11, House 3 is the inside and continuous cornered pattern. The outside and open corner is Feature 10, House 4. St. I bottom. 8.2 DD. [Feature 10] This house seems to be the earlier of the two (See House 3). Both the Northeast and Northwest corners showed up well enough when the more superficial and later closed-corner wall trench of House 3 was removed. It is to be noted that both structures used the same N wall trench. [Feature 11] This is judged to be the last house built because the wall trenches uniformly are the most shallow. The aspect of the trenches where they join also supports this thesis. It seems unusual that the closed corner trench should be the recent, but so it seems in this instance. It will be noted that most of these houses are oriented pretty closely to N-S. The burned area has been associated with this feature because of the fact that it is the more recent of the two and because the burned material seemed to end about at the wall trench of this house. </wpa:narrative>
