  <wpa:narrative>Summit A has been removed to -4.0 DD surrounding structure. 7l line profile stands. Pits 4 and 5 in 70R3 and old wall trenches also may be seen. Note vari-colored clays - typical of mound surface. Pits 4 and 5 were enclosed and partially so, respectively, within the structures. Pit 4 is a burial pit. There is no evidence that there was association of these with the feature. A good deal of heavy midden lay beneath the structure. Pit 5 was probably precedent to the structure inasmuch as the wall trench can be followed across pit 5. The same is true of several of the wall trenches which we were unable to associate. The burial, pit 4, may be associated with the feature. There is no evidence for this, however.</wpa:narrative>
