  <wpa:narrative>Burnt structure collapsed on floor. Clay covering remains wet and sticky making it difficult to remove. Fifty years of cultivation has filled gap between mound 1 and mound 2 making the latter difficult to discern and causing it to appear like a northernly elongation of mound 1. Abundant evidence of split cane and grass thatching lying over net work of small poles from 2" to 3" in diameter. Surface at apex 30" above floor. A few irregularly arranged post molds encountered on floor. Excavation may not have been sufficiently large to locate walls of structure. It was decided not to excavate further due to large amount of earth thrown in that direction from mound 1. </wpa:narrative>
