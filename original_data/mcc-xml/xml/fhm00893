  <wpa:narrative>These logs were laying in an approximate NE to SW direction - close together and for the most part parallel. Localized deposits of ash under the logs and a small quantity of charred cane and thatch 10.0' to the south suggest that the material is the ruined superstructure of a house. The ascending relative position of the log molds from NW to SE and the hardness of the embedding soil suggest that logs were footholds on a gentle slope at one of the periods of the construction of the primary mound.</wpa:narrative>
