  <wpa:narrative>This structure is in the village under the mound but slightly above the old humus zone. It is a rather small ceremonial type building delineated by postmolds set in wall trenches. These trenches stop somewhat short of the the end of each wall and the balance of the walls are made up of post molds, thus closing the corners. At the southwest corner there are three molds at the end of each wall, while at the northeast corner there are two at the end of each of each wall. The west end of the north wall showed no extra mold while the adjoining section of the west wall had two. The southeast corner was badly disturbed by Feature 58 and 69. The floor was of hard packed clay and fairly regular. Near the center was a circular firebasin... The seat was of hard packed smoothed clay and fairly regular. Near the center was a circular fire basin raised .2' above the floor, a curb .6' wide around the depressed center section. The entire basin was 2.3' in diameter while the actual basin was 1'. It was .3' deep. The seat was of hard packed smoothed clay 8' long, 4.7' wide and 1.3' high. It had been partially destroyed by the Indians building Feature 61. The wall posts were set vertically in the wall trenches and showed no evidence of structural stress. The wall trenches were filled with earth; the lower section showing no evidence of horizontal log molds. Along the inside of the trench at the top (just below the floor) were small log molds of decayed saplings that had been laid in place to help support the wall posts.</wpa:narrative>
