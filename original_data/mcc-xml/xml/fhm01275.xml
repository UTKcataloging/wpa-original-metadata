  <wpa:narrative>These have been slightly rearranged, but position is essentially accurate. Six triangular projectile points and a group of miscellaneous worked stones including a crude celt. Associated with Mound Phase B. [Burial Feature 47MG8] This burial was entirely disintegrated, only a few yellowish lines indicating bones. It is the only burial encountered in the mound that had artifacts associated with it. The pit was roughly rectangular and originated at the top of Mound Phase B (see 3.5-line profile) and extended into subsoil for about 4' where the skeleton was deposited. This probably accounts for the complete disintegration of the skeleton. The pit was sunk from the sloping top of Mound Phase B as shown on the 3.5-line profile. The artifacts were deposited in two groups as shown. There was a slight trace of bone under the grave goods in the north end of the pit.</wpa:narrative>
