  <wpa:narrative>The post mold pattern is regular and clear, forming a large oblong. There is no burned floor area of any great area, however localized areas of burned silt varying from 0.1' to 0.5' in thickness occur throughout the structure, coming in at the level of the post mold. The character of the soil at the level of the post molds changed conspicuously from the overlying mottled silt and clay. The floor level soil is a rich, greasy black loam containing a considerable quantity of very fragmentary charcoal. Presumably this is the floor level of the structure - the post molds are apparent in it, but are covered by the overlying fill.</wpa:narrative>
