  <wpa:narrative>This is a large circular structure with a double row of post holes and in some places a third row for reinforcement. There were several large pits that started from the floor and probably served as cache pits. No fireplace was found but the floor was of burned clay. Above the floor were considerable areas of charcoal and sand. Most of the way around the structure and between the inner and outer row of post holes was a domed ridge of hard packed clay that may have been a bench. The post holes were absolutely vertical and the large molds had an average depth of 2.5'. Interspersed between the large molds were small ones with an average depth of 0.5'.</wpa:narrative>
