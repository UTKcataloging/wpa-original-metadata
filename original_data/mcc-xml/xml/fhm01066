  <wpa:narrative>This feature consists of a small burnt area and scattered charcoal remnants surrounding it. It seems certain that it represents a structure. There are no traces of post molds nor of any wood over one inch in diameter. The structure probably was a lean-to of brush. The charcoal which lies along the edge of the burnt floor appears to be small burnt branches. The floor seems to be only burnt local soil, no special preparation having been made.</wpa:narrative>
