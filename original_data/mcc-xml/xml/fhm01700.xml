  <wpa:narrative>[3SW7] This burial was placed in its back in a well-made stone box grave of the Tennessee-Cumberland type. The bone was in an extremely poor state of preservation and this in spite of the fact that water drainage away from the burial was very good. Acidic soil and possibly considerable age are responsible. This was a double burial with 3SW7A. It hardly seems possible that two individuals in the flesh could have been placed in a stone box of this size and hence it seems necessary to postulate a reburial with the bones placed in more or less anatomical order. [3SW7A] See form 3SW7. Double burial with 3SW7. Less bone preserved in this burial. See also notes on reburial.</wpa:narrative>
