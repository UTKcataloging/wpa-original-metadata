  <wpa:narrative>The probable location of the wall trench was marked, as shown in the photograph. This east wall was destroyed by a wall of Feature 15.This structure is delineated by a postmold pattern set in wall molds. The corners are open except for corner post molds. There is no definite floor and level shown in the picture is that of the top of the post molds. The east wall wasn't found and the indications are that it was destroyed by Feature 15 molds and wall. The fire basin is 1' in diameter and 0.2' deep. It is very poorly made of baked clay and level with the floor of the structure. The posts were set vertically in wall trenches and showed no evidence of strain. The wall trench was filled with earth and there was no indication of horizontal support logs having been used.</wpa:narrative>
