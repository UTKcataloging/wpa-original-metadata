  <wpa:narrative>Located just outside of the limits of Caryville, Tennessee on U.S. Highway No.25. The mound was built on the natural surface in the bottom land along Cove Creek. The land at this point is rolling and fertile being protected from three sides by mountains and foothills. To the north-west lies Cumberland Mountain Ridge and directly west this ridge is broken by Caryville Cove from which Cove Creek is formed, and the mountain ridge then continues along the southwest uninterruptedly. Along the south and southeast flows Cove Creek flowing to Clinch River. A high protective ridge lies to the southeast of the mound rising at the bank of Cove Creek. The land at the present time is under cultivation. The last crop raised on this land was corn, and according to the farmers in the vicinity, the ground is exceptionally rich. From local sources it has been said that this particular field has been under cultivation for the last hundred years.</wpa:narrative>
