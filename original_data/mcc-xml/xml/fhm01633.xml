  <wpa:narrative>This burial deposited in a very deep symmetrically circular pit with sides that slope inward toward the top. The sides near the bottom round to a slightly rounded bottom. The pit was sunk into the compact sand sub-strata. Preservation was poor, partly because of the depth of the pit probably. The individual, if an adult, would have to have been very tightly flexed to fit into the confines of such a pit. This seems to be the case, judging from the very fragmentary remains.</wpa:narrative>
