  <wpa:narrative>This situation was very complicated, many of the trenches crossing each other, others running into single channels. Only evidence for chronological order lies in relative depth of trenches and in determination of precedence through markings showing in the fills. Average postmold diameter ca. 0.3'. Average interstices ca. 0.5'. Interstices not uniform.</wpa:narrative>
