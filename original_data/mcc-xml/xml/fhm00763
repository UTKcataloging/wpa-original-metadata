  <wpa:narrative>This palisade extends on 3 sides of the village site, the north, east, and south. On the west side of the site was the Tennessee River. Along the north end the palisade is in the form of a double row of post molds. The north row, however, has a section of Wall Trench Mold. The mold are large and deep and are irregularly spaced and placed in line. The north row is 264' long while the south row is 223.5' long. The north row extends 3' over the river bank at the west end while at the east end it is only the south row that turns south along the edge of the slough. The palisade runs for 372' south along the slough and then cuts across a point of land, turns west and runs in back of mound 8HA1. This latter section is called Feature 2, 8HA1. The palisade belongs with the original humus group since the post molds were found at the top of the original humus and never in the fill. In places erosion had cut the post holes down until they could only be found by going slightly below the yellow clay-sand loam that had been deposited over them. In such cases, the fill level (Stratum II) was always over them resting on the clay loam, thus indicating that a heavy period of erosion preceded the formation of the fill level.</wpa:narrative>
