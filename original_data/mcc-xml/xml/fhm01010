  <wpa:narrative>The wall pattern did not appear until nearly one foot below this level. The black in the center of the floor was left to show vertical relationship from floor to surface of land. See plat for placement of material. [Feature 2] While the floor of this structure lies near the base of Level II, indications of the structure extend to the base of the plowzone. At the base of the plowzone, a dark, carbon-filled area was visible that conformed roughly to the outline of the house floor. It would seem, then, likely that the house did occupy a pit that was dug from this plane or above, and that after the abandonment or destruction of the building the remaining depression was used as a garbage dump. ...There is a small area around the fire basin where the floor is prepared and burnt.... ...The postmold pattern did not appear until a foot more of soil had been excavated [after this photo was taken]. The postmold pattern locates the pottery vessels, nearly all of which lay upside down, against the wall and, in some cases, between the posts.</wpa:narrative>
