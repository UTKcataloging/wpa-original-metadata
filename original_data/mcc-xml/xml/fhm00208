  <wpa:narrative>Burial 15BY14 intrusive to structure. Rectangular structure with rounded corners. Countersunk from base of plowzone 1.1 to 1.4 into basic clay. North side higher than South part. Firebasin in center round, with raised curb and lined with puddled clay; about 0.8' deep. Post holes around edge 0.6 diameter and 1.6 average depth. Post holes in center seem to form partitions or are supports for radiating beams, these posts are slightly smaller and shallower than peripheral posts. On floor lay 0.1' to 0.3' of yellow-green clay - this apparently fell from roof. See ground plan for extent. Floor near fire basin burned red and hard, rest of floor composed of laminations of clay - not much midden material in floor. See note book page 53. Drawing on special sheet.</wpa:narrative>
