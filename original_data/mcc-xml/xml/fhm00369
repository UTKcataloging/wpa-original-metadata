  <wpa:narrative>The second row of molds (lower level at left) belong to feature 17. The post molds were so numerous at this level that it is almost impossible to distinguish a definite structure outline. It is quite possible that there are at least two outlines of structures at this level. The floor was a definite one, and covered with a thin layer of white sand. Many of the holes, shown in the chart, no doubt came down from the level above. The extension of pits (where burials were removed) downward also increased the difficulty of completing the outlines. Holes which probably belong to the upper level are shown in green.</wpa:narrative>
