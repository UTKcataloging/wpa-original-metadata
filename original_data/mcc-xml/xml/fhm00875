  <wpa:narrative>Hard packed level floor surface and rows of post molds. Two areas on floor indicating former existence of fires. The floor was a fairly smooth hard packed sand and clay expanse, the general limits of which were determinable. Outside the edge of the floor on the south, east, and west, fairly regular rows of postmolds suggested that these sides had been closed by a super-structure of some sort. No row or wall line of postmolds could be found along the north side. A row of postmolds from NW to SE suggests a partition dividing the feature into two parts. Each half has a burned area suggesting a fireplace. </wpa:narrative>
