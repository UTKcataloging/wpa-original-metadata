  <wpa:narrative>[Feature 13] This structure is circular, delineated by a wall mold with large post holes on the inside spaced Ca. 6' apart. The structure lies entirely within Feat. 14 but is on a slightly higher level and is not concentric to Feat. 14. Centrally located is a small, shallow carelessly made fire basin 0.2' deep, rectangular in shape (1' x 0.6') and shows no indication of having been made of puddled clay. Around the basin is a burnt area, indicating that possibly the fire wasn't always confined to the basin. The structure lies on Level C and has a floor that slopes slightly upward conforming to the mound slope of Level C which is higher at the West than the East. For this reason, a section of wall was cut away before it was noticed and is indicated by dashed lines. There are a number of misc. post molds but since it isn't possible to assign them definitely to either Feature 13 or 14 they are plotted only on the large plat. It is not believed by the excavator that Feature 13 and 14 formed a single structure since, while Feature 13 lies within Feature 14, it is not placed in such a way that a building could have been erected by using the outside and inside circle of posts for an even roof construction since at places Feature 13 is only 1' or so from Feature 14 while at others it is as much as 4 feet away. Posts were all vertical and showed no signs of stress. The wall trench was shallow and filled with earth which in a few places showed indications of charred material that may have well been a log. The technique of superstructure and the form cannot be judged from the evidence. [Feature 14] This structure is circular, being delineated by a wall mold which averages 0.7' to 0.8' in depth and Ca. 0.7' wide. On the inside of the wall mold are the large post molds spaced Ca. 6' apart. There is no evidence of the nature of the superstructure and consequently the less said the better. Obviously, large posts supported the weight of the roof and possibly brush and cane filled in the wall area. There is a small, carelessly made fire basin that was filled with ash and charcoal. The basin was 0.9' in diameter and 0.2' deep and shows no signs of puddling. The floor around the basin is burnt brick red as is the basin itself. This structure has been built on Level C and conforms to the slope of the level and hence the structure is higher at the West than at the East. Because of this a small section of wall was cut out and is indicated by dashed lines. This structure surrounds Feat. 13, a structure in all respects similar except that it is smaller. The presence of two fire basins and the lack of conformity between these two strctures argues that they were independently built. The misc. post molds are shown on the large plat.</wpa:narrative>
