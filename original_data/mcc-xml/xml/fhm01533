  <wpa:narrative>House number 3. [Feature 3] This structure lies at the very bottom of the apparent Mississippi deposit and on top of a sterile alluvian layer or zone which in turn lies on an Old Humus band which seems to be quite sterile in this area. A fair percent of limestone tempered sherds at the depth of the deposit give some indication that there is no natural separation between the Woodland and Mississippi deposit here. Only a post mold pattern found and no evidence of a superstructure. Posts were quite large at the base.</wpa:narrative>
