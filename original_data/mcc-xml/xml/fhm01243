  <wpa:narrative>This ramp is directly under Feat. 38B ramp and was somewhat better made. It has an inclination of Ca. 45 degrees and the top surface has been cut into rather crude steps. A considerable amount of erosion is apparent over the top surface and apparently it had been exposed to the weather for a considerable period.</wpa:narrative>
