  <wpa:narrative>No bone was found within this pit except a very small piece that was almost completely disintegrated. The pot specimen was very interesting, being two small pots joined together by an open tube. The pit was of unusual interest because of the ring of chert rocks surrounding the top of the pit. At the bottom of this pit was some evidence of pulverized bone found. This form of burial is rather unique, and while the sherds found, as well as the pot could be Tennessee-Cumberland, they show disticnctive characteristics.</wpa:narrative>
