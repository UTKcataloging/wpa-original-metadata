  <wpa:narrative>House number 12. [Feature 12] This structure was delineated by large, widely spaced post molds ranging from 1.5' to 2' deep. The corners were square with no difference in the spacings of the molds. A burnt, carefully prepared floor was present over most of the area, although large sections had been disturbed by intrusive material such as post molds, pits and burials. It was impossible to assign to this structure any of these miscellaneous molds - however four large but very shallow molds were spaced around the fire basin in such a way as to indicate roof supports. Thsese were from 1' to 1.3' in diameter and 0.3' to 0.9' in depth. Flat slabs of rock were found at the bottom and sides of these molds and were used to support them. Since they were not sunk very deep into the ground it would seem that they had been placed there after the roof was built and were kept in place by the weight of the roof. The fire basin was very well made, having a thick curb or rim ca. 0.2' above floor and 0.6' wide. The pit had a total width of ca. 1.2' and a depth of 0.3' or ca. 0.1' below the floor. Aside from the use of vertical wall posts separately set and heavy roof supports no evidence was available concerning the super-structure.</wpa:narrative>
