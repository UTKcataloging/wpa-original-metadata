  <wpa:narrative>[Feature 21] The east-west test trench south of the mound disclosed the post molds along the northeast corner of this structure. These were followed and the structure unearthed. The center hole is 2' deep and to the south lies a small fire pit rimmed with baked clay about 1/2" in thickness. At the probable doorway at the northeast corner were 2 flat limestone rocks. The molds averaged 4" in diameter all around without smaller molds on the corners. The average distance apart being three inches. A clay embankment extended along the west end approximately three-quarters of its length. This was 5" above the floor level at its highest point. (Note -- Storms at present time come down through the gap of mountains toward this same side of structure.) [Feature 26] See charts. This structure was surrounded by four ditches averaging 18" in depth and approximately 14" in width. The ditches were filled with dark loam with a double row of posts in the ditch, one row down the center (?), the other along the inner edge. Along the outer edge of the ditch and standing on edge were numerous stones (lime and sand) which apparently were used to assist in supporting and steadying the posts of the walls. With the exception of the east wall, it was difficult to trace the post mold in the ditches due to the fact that the ditches were filled with soft black loam which held no impression of the mold and made digging and tracing of the molds impossible. However, on the north end of the structure a portion of the ditch was covered with hard clay which preserved the post molds in excellent shape and the ditch and relationship of these molds has been photographed (5-291 and 5-292). </wpa:narrative>
