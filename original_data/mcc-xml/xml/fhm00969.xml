  <wpa:narrative>This square structure is delineated by post molds on the North and East sides and by wall molds on the South and West side. It lies directly under Feature 1 structure but can't be associated because Feature 1 showed a definite hearth level 4" higher. This structure had no central fire basin nor any post molds inside. It showed no evidence of burning and no artifacts were found.</wpa:narrative>
