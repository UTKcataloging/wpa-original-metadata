  <wpa:narrative>Limestone cave located one-half mile south of site 10 [John Ausmus Farm] From surface to floor of cave approximately fifteen feet. Washed material consisting of rock, dirt and wood on surface of floor. All skeltal material badly disarticulated, suggesting that bodies had been tossed into cave and left uncovered. A few artifacts and potsherds were intermixed with the skeletal material. Entrance to cave was a steep slope until floor was reached. From ceiling to floor of cave approximately eight feet. Width is eight feet. It is estimated that portions of skeletons numbering between fifteen and sixteen were recovered, among them two dolichocephalic skulls. Associated with the partial remains of a child were a number of olivella shell beads.</wpa:narrative>
