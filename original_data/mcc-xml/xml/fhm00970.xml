  <wpa:narrative>This structure was found 6" below the floor of Feat. 2 and since the floor of the above structure was so definite it cannot be associated with it as a subterranean floored structure. This structure is square with a wall mold on the West side and post molds on the other three. As seen from the plat this structure is smaller than the above structure and directly under it. This house shows a feature lacking in all the other house mounds excavated at this site. Namely the occurance of a good number of misc. post molds inside the structure. No fire basin was found and likewise no evidence of a general conflagration.</wpa:narrative>
