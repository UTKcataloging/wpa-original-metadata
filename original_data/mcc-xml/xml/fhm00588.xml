  <wpa:narrative>These post molds were seemingly the wall supports of a structure which had been erected above Structure 2. On covering over Structure 2 after firing, the mound builders used pure clay, not mixed with loam. This clay burned and formed a hard, irregular covering over Structure 2. Consequently, when the later structure was erected over Structure 2, the posts did not penetrate the actual hard pan, but were sunk into the clay above Structure 2. Excavation points to the assumption that the long row running east-west over Structure 2 was the south wall of this later structure, and the eight molds west and south of stake 8.5 were the posts of the east wall of the structure situated on the east side of a high clay bank and is above the floor level of Structure 2. </wpa:narrative>
