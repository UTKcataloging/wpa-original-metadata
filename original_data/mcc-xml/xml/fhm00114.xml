  <wpa:narrative>Two earth mounds before clearing. Mound #1 lies in a plowed feild on a terrain, which gradually slopes upward from the south. About a quarter of a mile to the south flows the Clinch River, and just across its banks rises Copper Ridge. To the north are also ridges. The mound had been cleared of a heavy growth of timber some years ago. Stumps of many of these trees remained and were removed with some difficulty during the excavating. About eight years previous the mound was disturbed, when a tunnel was dug into the south side by one of the natives. He reported that he had found no indication of burials. Before staking, the mound had to be cleared of a growth of young trees and shrubs. Roots were present throughout the mound, many of which had disturbed burials. (Staked and excavating begun June 4, 1934. Completed June 14, 1934). Mound #2, smaller of the earth mounds, is situated in a plowed field on a gradually sloping terrain. Sloping upward from the south, about a quarter of a mile flows the Clinch River, and just across its bank rises Copper Ridge. To the north are also ridges. The owner stated that the mound had been cleared of a heavy growth of timber some years ago. The stumps of many of these trees were left and proved a hindrance to excavating. Before the mound was staked off it was necessary to clear it of the growth of young trees and shrubs. Roots were present throughout the mound, many of which had disturbed burials. (Staked and excavating begun June 4, 1934. Completed June 11, 1934).</wpa:narrative>
