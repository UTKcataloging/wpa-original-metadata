  <wpa:narrative>Bottom of St. I where located -2.3 DD. Floor of House 36 -1.9 DD. This floor overlies the circular wall trench and is subsequent. Note number of wall trenches of square patterns running through the house. This house and the obviously related House 44 are shown together on the 1 to 2 ground plan. Unfortunately this structure was located in a maze of wall trenches. This was finally partially worked out, and while I cannot say that the circular structure was the earliest of the whole complex, it can be safely said to be one of the earliest. Part of the floor of the house 36 ran over the wall trench in one place (this shows in the photo). In another place a pile of limestone rocks and a pit cut through the circular wall trench - as did numerous straight ones. The firebasin cannot be certainly associated with the house - it is the most centrally located. Material was saved from the wall trench - that at least is precedent to house 35 but it seems typical of the site. Small firepits or perhaps pits for hot stones in 46R3 may go with this or with house 44. The wall trench of 35 was, in most places, fine and clear. See house 44.</wpa:narrative>
