  <wpa:narrative>Mound No. 2, the smaller of a group of two earth mounds, is situated in a cleared field and occupies a position on the inner bend of a small stream, Davis Creek. To the north, about a mile air-line, lies Cumberland Mountain, the nearest crest rising to an elevation of some two thousand feet. Southward, the terrain rises irregularly, forming a ridge of foothill. The owner of the mound property stated that the mound had been subject to plowing and erosion for many years. Its height had been reduced considerably, since an effort had been made to level the mound in order to facilitate cultivation. The original height of the mound probably extended upward several feet. It was somewhat different to ascertain the dimensions of the site, due to the erosion material that covered the periphery of the mound. (Staked March 12, 1934; excavation begun March 20; completed May 28, 1934).</wpa:narrative>
