  <wpa:narrative> This basin is the largest yet found but is so close to the plow line that the rim has been destroyed. It belongs to a structure, the floor of which has been destroyed. It was filled with ash. The basin represents two periods of development since at the south there is a small section of the 1st basin which was filled up by the the 2nd one. Stage 2 belongs to Feature 26 while the first stage structure can't be determined since the enormous number of post molds prevents alignment and hence no pattern of a structure.</wpa:narrative>
