  <wpa:narrative>Sunken from St. II down into undisturbed clay - about 0.4' into clay. Post molds alround inside sunken rim alternating large and small holes. Fire basin square with rounded corners. At northwest corner steps that may be part of entrance. Floor is very unven partly due to intrusive later post holes, partly at least not originally smooth. May have been an interior post of each corner, halfway to center. Floor slopes slightly away from fire basin. [Added later to document] Feature 41 may have alternating large and small post holes, two cases of very shallow small holes between larger holes were found. See Feature 43 where this is very plain. Thursday March 11, 1937: Finished clearing Feature 43. Semi-subterranean structure intrusive from St. II to sub-soil. Sunken into clay about 0.4'. Square with rounded corners. Post holes inside sunken area are alternating large and small. Fire basin square with rounded corners. Floor very uneven - apparently original condition. I cannot decide what this uneven floor signifies. Floor slopes away from fire basin. At NW corner raised step that may be part of entrance there. All pottery from floor was shell temper. F.S. 845.</wpa:narrative>
