  <wpa:narrative>Notes on the Reconstruction of a Middle-Mississippi Domestic Structure: Feature 9 on site 7HY5 was a structure measuring about 16 ft. square having wall trenches about 0.7' wide, including posts about 0.25' in diameter set therein. A square fire basin had been built into the floor slightly off the center. After clearing the floor and locating the trenches and postmolds, a lateral profile was cut through all four trenches, bisecting the postmolds. These postmolds were hollowed out and a search was made for poles of a like diameter. We discovered that posts 30 ft. in length, which retained this small size at the base, could be found along the river bottoms. ...From this beginning, having learned that it was no difficult task to obtain such poles, we experimented to find the length needed to make the most easily constructed and most stable structure. There are two bases upon which our architectural theories were formulated; one: concrete evidence which was found associated with this structure or with others similar to it, and two: apparent necessary factors leading to the ease of construction and the stability and practicality of the finished building. ....</wpa:narrative>
