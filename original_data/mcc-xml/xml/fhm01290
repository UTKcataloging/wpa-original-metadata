  <wpa:narrative>[Feature 41] This structure is practically square and is delineated by a post mold pattern of deep evenly spaced molds ca.4' in diameter. At the ends of each wall is a very small mold not over .2' in diameter but about as deep as the rest of the molds. A very smooth hard baked floor of sandy clay runs directly up the post mold pattern leaving no sign of a wall trench, however, on the inside of the post molds is a log mold just below the floor and in all probability a wall mold will show up when the floor is cut away. The hard baked dull red floor extends all over the inside of the structure running up to such features as the firebasin, platform, etc. There is considerable amount of charred material lying on the floor but very little of it is of much value in reconstructing the superstructure. No posts of logs remain but only charred, split can material covered over with thatch and in some cases a third layer of bark (See drawing of burnt material). Heavily laid over the post mold pattern is the earth bank (see Feature 40) which indicates that a heavy layer of earth was placed on the side walls. Overlying the entire floor was earth of a similar nature as Feature 40 and this, no doubt, fell from the roof of the building. Thus we may conclude that this structure was an earth lodge. The earth placed over the wooden framework was dome-like in appearance matching into the side slope of Level E. A cross-section drawing. Through Features 39 and 41 in reconstructed form. Inside this structure are a number of sub-features, 41A, B, C, D, and E, each of which will be fully described on separate sheets. Aside from these are a number of misc. post molds located to the north of Feature 41D and tending to subdivide this back section into small compartment-like areas. This area is separated by a partition (Feature 41D) from the rest of the building and the occurance of post molds directly behind this low clay partition indicates a high wall had been placed there. Most of these internal post molds were ca. 1.4 deep and 2' diameter although a few are as large as the wall post molds and may have been for post supporting the roof. The fire basin (41C) was about centrally located and in the larger of the two rooms directly in front of a small wooden seat (41E). Between the fire basin and the partitions 41D was a cache pit (41B). These three sub-features were to the south (or in front of) the partition. The partition dividing the structure is placed just in front of the platform (41A).... [Feature 41A] This platform is made of hard packed clay burnt to a smooth dull red on the surface. It is .8' high 5.6' long, 3.8 wide and rests on the floor of Feature 41. It was thinly covered with Feature 40 earth. The sides are slightly sloping making the base of the platform somewhat larger than the top. There is an irregular post mold pattern at the back of the seat but it doesn't seem to have any specific relation to it. In front of the platform is Feature 41D partition which is open in the center to allow the person sitting on the seat to look into the larger room. [Feature 41B] This cache pit lies just to the south of partition 41D and to the north of the fire basin. The side wall and bottom are well defined but not smoothed, nor does the pit show any particular care in manufacture. The sides are nearly vertical but both ends slope rather gently to the bottom and at the west end the pit fans out to its greatest width. Two fair sized post molds are in the western down slope. Feature 40 lay in this pit to a depth of several inches. [Feature 41C] This fire basin is almost centrally located and is raised .1' above the floor on a square base. The fire pit is circular, .7' in diameter and .2' deep. It was completely covered over by white ashes and they extended down into the fire pit. Over the ashes Feature 40 lay very thin with some of the ash showing through. The basin was made of puddled clay burnt brick red. [Feature 41D] This clay ridge divides the interior of this structure into two sections or rooms. The larger being to the South and containing sub-features 41 B,C and E and the smaller to the North containing sub-features 41A and a number of small post molds which again subdivide this back room. This clay partition doesn't meet in the center, but leaves an opening of 0.3' in front of the platform. The ridge averages 0.6' to 0.7' high and Ca. 1' wide and directly in back of it is a row of post molds that indicate posts for the complete partition wall. The ridge was made of clay smoothed and burnt red. [Feature 43] This structure is rectangular in shape and is delineated by deep rather evenly spaced post molds. A fairly hard, well made floor of packed sandy clay burnt dull red in many areas runs directly to the post molds, leaving no sign of a wall trench. However, on the inside of the post molds and just below the floor is a log mold. On the floor are a number of misc. post molds most of which are a the western end back of the platform 43A. Roughly these divide this section into small compartments. The subfeatures on the floor are independently described. This location is shown on the plat for this structure. The platform, two pits and fire basin are all on an east-west central axis through the structure. Feature 40B encircled this structure lying heavily over certain sections of the post mold pattern, while over the entire floor, thin in the central sections and much thicker toward the wall was a mass of clay that in all likelihood fell from the roof. From this evidence it becomes evident that this structure was an earth lodge in all essential respect similar in form (see Feature 41 form) to Feature 41. There is practically no burnt material on the floor of this structure -- just a little piece of thatch at the southwest corner. The log mold on the inside of the post mold pattern in ca 6' deep but ranges from .3' to .9'. The effect is exactly what one would expect if the small ends of saplings were doubled over the end of another sapling where two were laid together, end to end. This, of course, was necessary because it would have been very difficult to have found single saplings long enough to have reached the length of the wall. These log molds were found only on the north and south walls and were not present for the east and west walls. Further no log mold was bound at the bottom of the post molds on the opposite side; however molds were set in a wall trench. [Feature 43C] This fire basin is on the E-W central axis through the structure [Feature 43], is square and raised above the floor 0.1'. The basin is of very interesting form. The curb or base is Ca. 0.9' wide on each side. Then there is a drop of 0.2' to a square inside basin in the center of which is a circular depressed basin. The basin is made of puddled clay burnt brick red. When found, the entire basin was covered with a layer of white ashes which also lay in the basin proper.</wpa:narrative>
