  <wpa:narrative>This platform is made of hard-packed sandy, mottled grey clay and the surface had been baked hard and smooth. The platform is raised 1.4 above the floor of the mound Feature 38 and is somewhat west of the center point being ca. 3' farther west than the ramp. This platform apparently was not under a shelter but exposed to the weather. That it shows no sign of weathering may be due to the fact that a skin of some sort was kept over it. Feature 40 overlay the entire north half of the feature to a thickness of ca. 0.5'. Correction note: Further excavation indicates that a shelter had been built over the top area of the pyd. mound Feature 38 similar to the one noted for pyramidal mound Feature 39.</wpa:narrative>
