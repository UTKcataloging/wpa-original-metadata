  <wpa:narrative>Feature #20, oblong pit in foreground located in 70R2, had pit filling consisting of a blueish grey clay mixed with yellow iron stained clay. The following artifacts were found within: F.S. #39 (10 pieces worked stone), F.S. #40 (1 piece worked stone and 5 projectile points), and F.S. #58 (3 possible pieces of worked stone from pit fill). Pit was probably a burial pit from which all indications of a burial are gone. Circular pit adjoining Feature #20 is Feature #21. Artifacts recovered from this feature include F.S. #38 (9 pieces of worked stone and 6 sherds of pit fill). The pit fill consists of a blueish grey clay mixed with yellow iron stained clay in this well defined pit. Both pits are 1.90' below surface and rising water made them difficult to excavate. In upper right hand corner is Feature #22, charcoal basin.</wpa:narrative>
