  <wpa:narrative>Feature #16 (possible burial pit) located in 65R2 at 0.85' below surface. Dimentions are 5.9' x 1.6' x 0.4' deep. Very shallow pit but it is possible that it went unrecognized during excavation. Pit fill was a gulf colored and light bodied clay and was not the same as other burial pits. F.S. #33 (greenstone spade) in left center and F.S. #34 (greenstone spade) to center right.</wpa:narrative>
