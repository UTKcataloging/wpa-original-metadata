   <abstract>[Feature 21] This structure is delineated by post molds set in wall molds and lies directly over Feature 22 (although floor level is the same and the reverse could be true). No internal feature found except an area of charcoal and ash. No fire basin nor a definite floor found. No evidence as to how structure was destroyed. At the east and northeast corner wall trench is the same as for Feature 22. The posts were set vertically into wall trenches filled with earth. There was no indication in them that horizontal support logs had been placed. The corners are open with the wall trenches lacking some of coming to the corners. At the northwest and southwest corners corner posts were used outside of the wall trenches while at the other two corners they were not used. [Feature 22] This structure seems to be directly under Feature 21 (although the actual level is the same) and is delineated by post molds set in wall molds. There is no definite floor nor any internal features. The corners are open and at the SW corner is a corner post mold. The north wall runs two feet past the west end wall, but there is no evidence as to why this was so. The posts were set vertically in the wall trenches. The trenches were filled with earth and showed no indication of horizontal support logs having been used.</abstract>
