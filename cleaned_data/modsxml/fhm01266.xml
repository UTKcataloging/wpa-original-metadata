      <title>204MG31 Hiwassee Island Site 37MG31, Meigs County, Tennessee. 37MG31 - Earth mound. Feature 69, Large rectangular floor pattern found in village deposit beneath mound. Two distrubed fireplaces appear in center of floor. Direction west</title>
   </titleInfo>
   <abstract>The one closest to the foreground has been destroyed when the fire place for Feature 58 was constructed and the fireplace to the rear appeared to have been partially destroyed at the time floor Feature 58 was laid. [Feature 69] This structure is on the village area below the mound but is just above the old humus. It is a large ceremonial type of building delineated by posts set in wall trenches. A heavy clay from the above structure had settled down into the wall trench and made the location of postmolds very difficult, many of them only becoming apparent by vertical cutting. The wall trenches sloped abruptly at the corners leaving a gap between trenches. This was filled by two small postmolds, one at the end of each wall trench, except at the NE corner, which was left open. The floor of this structure has been badly distrubed by Feature 58 above, but patches of it were found intact. Along the long central axis are two firebasins equi-distant from the E and W walls. Both of these two basins apparently belonged to this structure. Both have been badly disturbed by the structure above. The westernmost fire basin was directly under that of Feature 58 and hence little is left other than the bottom of it. Apparently, however it was well made of puddled clay, circular in shape and was raised slightly above the floor. The other basin was also circular, made of puddled clay and raised slightly above the floor. A depth of .4' can still be seen but that is only a fraction of its original depth. The walls of the basin were vertical and the botom of both basins was flat. The wall posts were set vertically in the wall trenches and showed no evidence of side thrust. The wall trenches were filled with earth and showed no evidence of having had horizontal support logs placed in them.</abstract>
