      <title>198BY13 Ledford Island Site 16BY13, Bradley Co., TN. Feature 31, Completely exposed showing fire basins, postmolds and pits</title>
   </titleInfo>
   <abstract>Semi-subterranean structure with three central fire basins intrusive from base of plow zone. At base of plow zone outline of pit was traced with difficulty, but did definitely extend to plow zone. Edges somewhat destroyed by plow marks. West corner seems to be in error as post mold outline is about 3.0 inside of pit outline as finally traced. At floor level in west corner a small area of burned, puddled clay was found -- this is apparently an intrusion to Feature 31 and has no connection with it. It probably explains the length of that corner. The east corner could not be traced as there seems to be several intrusive posts here. The entrance consists of two external trenches with a cross trench and a longer trench parallel with external trenches, to the south. Along NW side there are two small pits intrusive to pit edges, they come from plow zone. Post holes were very numerous and many were multiple. Several large depressions 0.3 - 0.6 were found in the floor; these had sloping sides and irregular outlines. Just northwest of entrance was a large cache pit - pit 46. Near north corner two pits, C. and D., were found. These had flat bottoms and fairly vertical sides, definitely cache pits. At top of pits at floor level were five river pebbles. In SW side and just SW of firebasin were two large pits -- these seem to have been cache pits but have intrusive post molds and are poorly preserved. Pit A, near wall, is probably two cache pits. Pits E and F near south corner are cache pits with vertical walls and flat bottoms. No cache pits showed signs of fire and all were filled mixed humic earth. Burials 194, 182, 166, and 175 are probably intrusive to structure. The rest (176, 183, 191, 198) seem to have been buried in subfloor pits during occupation of house. All are infants or children. 16BY176 was a very small infant buried in small pit against sides of which large sherds of a pot were placed. Floor, especially around edges, was covered with 0.1' to 0.3' of hard packed occupational detritus.... Another shallow basin may have been present at NW side of floor. Floor as a whole quite uneven. See notebook #2, p.5, 6, 8, 10.</abstract>
