      <title>CE10(A) [1151-TVA] John Ausmus Farm Site 3CE10, Claiborne County, Tennessee. Mound 2. Feature 12, the inner top structure of three rectangular post mold patterns</title>
   </titleInfo>
   <abstract>[Feature 12] Note: Four corner molds, regularly placed inside, which are probably roof supports. A well defined structure, the southwest corner of which was accidentally cut away by workmen. The floor is a definite one, showing evidence of fire in a number of places, but no indications of a burned structure. Molds are 4" to 6" in diameter, usually shallow. On the north end, the floor extended outward from line of molds for a distance of probably five feet. It is quite possible that the original floor to this structure had been plowed away, since the molds are shallow and the floor extended so far beyond one side. Also the plowed surface of the mound, less than above might tend to strengthen this theory. Note: The row of molds separated by green lines appeared when the floor was being cleaned. They were charted in at this level, but probably belong to a structure beneath, as shown on chart of Feature 16.</abstract>
