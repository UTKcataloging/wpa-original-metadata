   <abstract>[Feature 5 is associated with Feature 8]. [Feature 8]Over the floor of this structure was a considerable mass of split cane matting and an occasional charred log. However, the charred material doesn't give any indication of structural form. In the center of the structure is a circular burned area; probably the fireplace. A number of stones, averaging 1-1/2" thick and 3" to 4" long, were lying on the floor of the structure, many of them near pots. The inference is that they were used in heating water, etc. This inference is strengthened by the fact that a stone was found inside one pot. The post molds were found at the outer edge of the burned area. In order to find them, it was necessary to cut down below the floor level. Except at the NW corner, the corners were square and the post molds were vertical, showing no tilt to indicate that the posts might have been pulled inward. The fact that burnt clay lay over the entire structure indicates that the roof as well as the walls have been plastered with clay. The presence of smoothed wattle work indicates that the clay had been fired on the structure, but the point is debatable. [Feature 5] This burned area overlies considerable charcoal and burned cane, and in many places the clay is in the form of wattle work. It averages .2' to .3' in depth. In square 45L5 a burial pit (7HA8 - 7HA9) was sunk through the clay from above level. The burned clay is more heavily concentrated on the southern half of the structure and overlay the post molds of the south wall.</abstract>
