      <title>155RE12 DeArmond Site 2RE12, Roane County, Tennessee. Feature 34, Floor exposed, daub removed, leaving burned superstructure and circular firebasin. Sq. 41R1. Direction north-northeast</title>
   </titleInfo>
   <abstract>Despite abundance of superstructure material which was found on the floor, little could be said about the nature of the roof and walls. However, the relationship of the size of the post molds and the posts within should be noted. Roughly speaking, the holes were about twice the diameter of the posts, in cases where wood was found in the post molds. The thatch was hung vertically so that when found on the floor next ot the walls, the longitudinal axis of the grass was perpendicular to the axis of the wall. The house pit was very sharply delineated after the plow disturbance had been removed. Within the limits of the house pit, the soil was very black and was shot through with finely disintegrated daub. Excepting the area around the fire basin, the floor of this structure was accretive. On this limited central area however, a thin sand clay mixture had been spread, possibly to cover the filth, and this material had burned to a bright red. Note that the prepared section of floor was almost entirely covered by burned roof daub. This resulted in a fairly good collection of pottery and artifacts which were absolutely associated with this house. In addition a collection of nuts was made. These were not found between roof and floor, but such an accumulation on the accretive floor suggests that they were not dumped in as part of the midden filling the house pit. The entrance was a rectangular extension of the house pit and had about the same depth. It was in the southwest wall near the south corner. It will be noted that there are superfluous post holes shown on the detail ground plan for this house. Feature 34 was superimposed on another structure which was not excavated, so it is probable that some of these molds belong to this structure. The chipping station, Feature 34A, lay partly on burned consolidated floor. Incidentally, about .1' of midden material had accumulated between the top of the floor and the bottom of the chipping station. The station was near the entrance.</abstract>
