      <title>10-552 John Ausmus Farm Site 3CE10, Claiborne County, Tennessee. Mound 2. Feature 14, View from north. Interior view showing charred posts and material before removal. Note half of large stone discoidal at right</title>
   </titleInfo>
   <abstract>A well defined pit, the red burned clay sides of which extended about two inches above the floor of top structure (Feature 12). It was first thought that the pit was an ash pit, before the red burned sides were discovered. After being cleaned out, it was found that the burned clay extended almost three feet downward. At the south end, evidence of what was first thought to be a cremation appeared. The floor was lined with bark (pine?) which had been charred. Charred wood, evidently posts, were placed around the south end, and evidence had been previously found that indicated that posts had been placed around the whole pit. The south floor of the pit was heaped with chunks of burned clay, underwhich was found a layer of split cane weaving. When the top layer was removed, four stone discoidals (one large) were found, two of which had been cracked open by heat. Also, the pieces of a charred bone tool, a large chunk of graphite were found. Throughout this was a mass of substance, appearing to have been fused by heat. Underneath this mass, was more cane weaving, lying on the bark covered floor. No charred bone, other than that of the bone tool, could be found, although a thorough search was made. Note: the top part of the pit, just below the floor level of top structure Feature 12 was filled with ash material. This pit was probably constructed from the level of Feature 12, or from the floor level preceding, if there had been one. The burned sides protruding above the floor level might indicate this -- and the nearness of the plowed surface of the mound -- as mentioned in Feature 12. Note: the artifacts appeared to have been placed in a woven sack back, placed in the bottom of the pit and burned.</abstract>
