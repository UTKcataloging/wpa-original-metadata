      <title>71BE3, 15BE3, Boone County, Kentucky. Robbins Large Mound Site. Progress Photograph</title>
   </titleInfo>
   <abstract>Photograph taken from the south of the subject. Profiles incised for emphasis. Indicated are workmen preparing the faces of profiles for study and photographing ... careful trowelling of all surfaces and incising of apparent structural divisions. The two lower men are working on a portion of the 65' face showing a vertical section through Tomb #4 (Feature #27). Beneath the tarpaulin to their right is the partially exposed Tomb #1 (Feature #3). The man on the upper ledge is engaged in defining the Tomb #5 ( Feature #4) as its structural character is revealed in the 70' face. The main background profile is that of the 75' face. Above the upper man's head is the vertically sectioned Tomb #2 (Feature #13) and immediately to its right and abbuting against it is the also vertically sectioned Tomb #7 (Feature #14). In the lower left of the 75' face is indicated the concavity created by the collapse of the earth roof of Tomb #5 (Feature #4) which has been used later as the location of the Tomb #6. When this photograph was taken in March of 1940 a great deal of the west and east zones, or mound skirt, had been removed as an expedient to keep the crew occupied during the preceding severe weather, and that in relatively sterile archeological section of mound.</abstract>
