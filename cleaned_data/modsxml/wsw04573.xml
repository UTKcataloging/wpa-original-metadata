      <title>73BE3, 15BE3, Boone County, Kentucky. Robbins Large Mound Site. Portions of the 65, 70, and 75' Profiles</title>
   </titleInfo>
   <abstract>Photograph taken from the south of the subject. Profiles incised for emphasis. On the foreground block is Tomb #1 (feature #3) as exposed up to the 65' face. Reflected in the 65' face behind this tomb are vertical sections of the earth wall around it and the dipping loads of the collapsed earth roof. Note the correction in the line defining the concavity caused by the collapse of this roof ... this is an alteration over this portion of the 65' profile appearing in the earlier photographs. This concavity is the location of Tomb #3 (Not Featured). To the left of Tomb #1, in the 65' face, is a vertical section through Tomb #4 (Feature #37) showing the tilting loads of the collapsed earth roof and the slightly raised wall on each side of the tomb. The small hole on the line defining the tomb floor is a section through the east log mold of the tomb. The uppermost line in the 65' face above Tomb #4 has bark on it and is the outer skirt of the superimposed Tomb #5 (Feature #4) floor. The small intermediate profile is that of the 70' face. Because of the angle of the camera little is clearly evident. The concavity indicated on the extreme right of this face is that of collapsed Tomb #31 (Feature #15). On the extreme left are indicated two dipping lines constituting the walls of Tomb #5 (Feature #4) dipping down to the floor level of this tomb. The major background profile is that of the 75' face. The concavity on the lower left of this face is that created by the collapse of the roof of Tomb #5 (Feature #4) which was utilized as the location for the superimposed Tomb #6 (Not Featured). Above to the right of Tomb #2, on the same level and abbuting against the east wall of the same, is Tomb #7 (Feature #14) ... the small foreground block projecting from the 75' face of this tomb supports the legs of Burial #43 exposed in the 70-75' section.</abstract>
