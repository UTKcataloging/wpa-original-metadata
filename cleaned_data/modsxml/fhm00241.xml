      <title>93BY11 Rymer Site 15BY11, Bradley Co., TN. Feature 43, Double fire basin at extreme right. Feature 45, Dwelling house floor pattern to the left of Feature 43. Feature 36, House floor pattern to the left. Square 29R8. Direction southwest</title>

   <abstract>[Feature 43] Double firebasin, both round and neither seems to have had raised curb. Basins lined with hard baked puddled clay. Walls vertical, bottom flat. These basins probably represent one structure later than Feature 35 as on higher level. One of entrance passages to east may belong to this feature. No post mold pattern could be found and no evidence of pit. [Feature 35] Semi-subterranean structure with central firebasin and entrance passageway (possibly multiple). All of pit outline could not be traced exactly - Northern side was very faint, apparently overlaid by part of Feature 35. Feature 43 firebasins at Southern edge are higher and quite definitely later than Feature 35. At NW corner a large pit intrusive to the house and extending 0.4' lower than house floor. Floor of structure uneven and overlaid with 0.1 - 0.2' of hard packed detritus wihch was deepest at firebasin. Firebasin rectangular without raised curb, lined with hard puddled clay. Bottom of firebasin flat and smooth. Clay below firebasin was burned 0.2' deep. Wattle mainly over center of floor was badly water soaked but seems to be at one time in fairly large pieces. Structure burned and parts of charred logs were recovered Southeast of firebasin, several stones and slabs of dolomite lay on floor. There were small amounts of burned grass thatch under wattle and on floor. [Feature 36] Semi-subterranean structure with central firebasin and entrance passage though we could not definitely trace pit. Top of subsoil was average of 9.1 around outside and 9.5 inside structure. This structure seems to be aligned in a N-S axis rather than NW-SE. Wattle overlying floor to a depth of 0.1' and 0.3' was in small pieces but seemed to contain grass and shredded bark thatch. No evidence of exact form of thatch could be found. Floor was mainly baked around basin but near NW corner was a small hard baked area, floor and bottom of firebasin were baked red to a depth of 0.2. Firebasin was rectangular and lined with hard puddled clay with raised curb 0.1' high. This basin was very well built and hard. Cutting north side of basin and in several other spots on floor were cache pits. These definitely were intrusive to floor but did not seem to cut wattle. Wattle may have been re-filled into pits in same order as it was taken out, thus accounting for relative small amounts of it in pits. Pits filled with mixed greyish earth. At southeast corner a group of 40 small stones scattered over floor. Just outside entrance at Northeast a pile of 22 stones in small pit that may be associated with structure.
