      <title>5SW1 Gray Farm Site 1SW1, Stewart Co., TN. Features 8 and 9, Two structures delineated by wall trenches and corner post molds. Burnt area near center, possibly floor, association unknown. Note bifurcated wall trench and Feature 8. Inclusive to Level 2. Sq. 4L11. Direction west</title>

   <abstract>[Feature 8] Structure found on top of second level. It is delineated by wall trenches with open corners, and at this opening is a corner post. No fire basin associated. Internally there was some evidence of floor, but this was rather indefinite and vague, being composed for the most part of hard packed sand, some ash, and consolidated patches of clay. This structure is one of four identifiable wall trench patterns, but identification of stratigraphic position has been nearly impossible, since there is very little to give evidence. Features 8 and 9, however, definitely originate at the surface level and are separated by less than 0.1'. Feature 10 and 11 wall trench are not so deep, and probably originate at a higher level. In this regard, Feature 6 basin probably associated with one of them. The north wall of this structure is peculiar, having bifurcated forks at each end. No explanation can be offered. [Feature 9] Square structure found on top of second level. Delineated by wall trenches with open corners in which are corner posts. No associated fire basin, however more or less centrally located is a burnt area of red clay that was covered with ash. This associates either with this structure or with Feature 8, this latter structure being on the same horizontal plane. Feature 10 and 11 seem to be from higher levels.</abstract>
