      <title>17-607 Charles Lea Farm Site 4AN17, Anderson County, Tennessee. Mound 2. Feature 3, Secondary floor</title>
   </titleInfo>
   <abstract>This was a sandy floor, burned and hardened in some areas, but if any altar or fireplace was originally on this floor it would have been destroyed by the cellar sunk in the middle of the mound. This floor, well defined in certain areas, certainly was surmounted by a structure. A few of the post molds were found (see chart). Just west of these post molds was found a few charred fragments of wood. In the post mold was found the stub of a post charred to the floor surface with the empty hole beneath were the butt end of the post had rotted away. This specimen was preserved, as well as those found on the floor. The broken potsherds and corn of Feature 2 were found benearth some of the charred wood taken from the floor. On the eastern edge of this floor just at the point where the ramp sloped down to post molds of lower structure, two post molds of 2' - 3' depth were found. (See cross sections and Feature 4 chart).</abstract>
