      <title>79MG31 Hiwassee Island Site 37MG31, Meigs County, Tennessee. 37MG31 - Earth mound. Feature 28, Floor pattern delineated by wall trenches, post-molds, and hearth located somewhat to the left of center. Direction east</title>
   </titleInfo>
   <abstract>This structure is practically identical with Feature 27 and so nearly the same level that for large areas the floor was the same for both dwellings. This can be seen by the fire basin which had been cut down horizontally so that the floor of Feature 27 could be placed over it. This basin apparently had been very well made of fired puddled clay. It is circular with a diameter of 1.9' and a present depth of 0.4'. As to whether or not it was raised above the floor no statement can be made since it had been cut partially away to allow the building of Feature 27. The structure is delineated by post molds set in wall molds. Corners are open. Only in the wall trenches is there burnt material that furnishes evidence that the dwelling burned. Since the structure was cleared before Feature 27 was built the mass of charred material was not found and hence no evidence as to superstructure form. The post molds show the same slant as was recorded for Feature 27, but there is no sign of the small stake molds of Feature 27.</abstract>
