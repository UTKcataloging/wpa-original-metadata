   <abstract>[Feature 2] Rectangular, postmold house. The evidence of floor on Feature 2 is very scanty. The firebasin was found at 2.0' datum depth, and a few patches of what possibly might have been flooring were seen at 2.1' - 2.2' datum depth. Midden material from most of the area had to be cleared away to 2.2' before post holes could be seen. These floors may have belonged to other houses (see following features). On the northwest side of the firebasin was found the bottom of a badly torn-up fire basin at 2.2' datum depth. If this was a shallow basin, it might have associated with the above mentioned floors. As can be seen, there are several structures represented at this level. The fire basin for Feature 2 is fairly well centered in the pattern, showing a wall along the northwest edge of the summit and another along the southwest side. It is assumed that this is the pattern belonging with the fire basin. The superfluous holes in the northwest wall probably came down from Feature 1 since this basin centers well in the pattern, also. While the dimensions are not exact, this house can probably be summarized as being about 22 feet wide, a few feet longer, approximately rectangular, probably with rounded corners, and with wall posts about 1 foot apart. The floor seems accretive, and any burning was probably incidental to the destruction of this or later houses, the burned debris probably being cleared away. The fireplace was prepared of clay, was circular in form with steeply sloped sides and a flat bottom. No curb was apparent. On the south east side of the summit can be seen segments of other patterns. These are so incomplete that feature numbers have not been assigned to them. In general these patterns closely follow the type described above. The area of the mound limits them to about the same size. The two fire basins just west of 50CA stake were very badly torn up. No ash was found in either. The circular was intrusive to the rectangular. In all likelihood they associated with fragmentary wall pattern on the southeastern corner of the plateau. Since there was no material definitely associated with the structures at this level, all the evidence was incorporated under the title "Feature 2". No artiface material was found with floor association, so that the only material listed is "Summit Phase B". Not all of the bags are marked in this manner. Bag markings should be disregarded. The F.S. Sheets give the correct associations. Obviously material from several houses is represented here. [Feature 3] Circular fire basin. Feature 3 is one of the group of 10 firebasins in the center of the summit of Phase B, to which little or no structural association can be given. From the evidence that was found, Feature 3 can be said to have been about 3.5 feet in diameter, roughly circular, flat-bottomed, with curving sides. The bottom was at 2.8' datum depth, but the rim was so cut up by the intrusions of Feature 1 and 2 that at no place did the sides stand more than 0.3' above the bottom. The drawing of the summit at 2.5' datum depth demonstrates the great profustion of wall post patterns. Feature 3 may have associated with any one of the northwestern group of patterns. There was a small quantity of ash in the bottom of Feature 3, but no specimens were found. The basin was quite thin, and was built of prepared clay. No definite tempering material could be ascertained, although the clay was slightly sandy. [Feature 4] Small circular fire basin. This small basin could not be successfully associated with any of the post hole pattern found at datum depth 2.2' or 2.5'. The basin was small, circular, with steep curving sides, and was relatively deep for its diameter. The bottom was flat. It was made of prepared clay, but it can not be said for certain that the complete depth was represented, for the rim might have been cut down by later structures. The rim, as observed, was flush with the rim of the rectangular basin of Feature 7. The basin may have been the sole fire place for one of the patterns on the northwest side of the summit, or may have been auxillary basin for a structure utilizing the whole Phase B summit. [Feature 5] Fragmentary rectangular fire basin. Very little of this basin remained. One corner and parts of two adjoining sides were found. The corner was oriented due north. The northwest side was cut by Feature 6, and Feature 7 cut off the southwest corner. On the northeast side, the basin came flush to the floor. The bottom was apparently roughly flat, sloping gently up to the floor level. No definite association with a wall pattern was possible. [Feature 7] Rectangular, post mold house, with rectangular basin. Feature 7 includes the rectangular fire basin and all of the post molds shown at datum depth 2.5'. Actually, on this stage of excavation can be seen fragments of wall patterns of eight or ten structures. These patterns undoubtedly associated with the extra fire basins (Features 3, 4, 5, 6, etc.) but they could not be matched up with any validity. From the fragmentary evidence of this group of houses very little can be said in summary. They were constructed with posts set in holes. The interstices seem to vary from about 1.0' to 2.5' although they are fairly regular in any given pattern. The walls are not particularly straight and there was probably no definite manner by which the corners were formed. In general the corners were oriented towards the cardinal points, but a variation of this can be demonstrated with the wall running from the vicinity of 51L1 to 4.0'N -4.0'W of 50R1. That the total mound summit was not used as a floor can easily be seen by reference to the southeastern prolongation of the summit area. Several houses used this area, and probably more than half of each structure lay on this prolongation. On the other hand, it does not seem likely that more than one structure was standing at once. The association of the pits with any one strucutre (or with all of them) is doubtful sine the only origin which could be given them was the level at which they were seen, and soil conditions were unfavorable for observation. Thus, the rectangular firebasin and a few patches of hard flooring were all that could be associated, together and called "Feature 7". The fire basin was incomplete, as can be seen by reference to the detailed drawing. In particular, it should be noticed that the external corners of the broad flat rims were broken down and otherwise incomplete. This bears strong resemblance to the "alters" shown in the Norris Basin report. Little can be said about the firebasin-like phenomena appearing in squares 48L1, 48R1, and 51L1. They were very fragmentary, but were slightly basin-shaped, contained a little ash, were burned red, and had slight traces of flooring at their edges. The evidence of form and function was so scanty that they have not been "featurized". Contemporanerty for all the pits can not be claimed, likewise for burials. Some were certainly intruded while the house was occupied.</abstract>
