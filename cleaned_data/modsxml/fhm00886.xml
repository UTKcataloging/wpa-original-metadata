      <title>204HA3 Hixon Mound Site 1HA3, Hamilton Co., Tennessee. Feature 67, Square, modeled, burned clay altar or fireplace at Floor O level in center of Feature 63. Square 25L11. Direction west</title>
   </titleInfo>
   <abstract>[Feature 67] This was a flat, raised rectangular fireplace with a central pit. The body of the feature was built up of grayish sand from the floor level and plastered over with puddled clay, subsequently burned hard - the edges and corners are modelled and rounded. Large cracks radiate from the central fire pit. A very small quantity of ash was taken from the pit. Feature 63] Rectangular structure (Floor O) (Refer also to description of Feature 73). Floor was a partially burned mixture of sand and clay. The trenches were dug and probably the posts were set at the Floor P level of Feature 73 for the superstructure of Feature 63. The intervening fill between the two floor levels was about 0.5' thick on average. The trenches for the N.Northeast and S.Southwest walls showed fairly clearly by soil contrasts. However, the trenches for the other two walls could not be seen by soil contrasts - the existence of a trench could only be ascertained by the manner in which the filling between the postmolds could be cleaned off. Exterior horizontal log molds showed only in the trenches on N.Northeast and east Southeast walls. At least two corners were closed up by large corner posts. One and possibly both of the other two were closed by small postmolds.</abstract>
