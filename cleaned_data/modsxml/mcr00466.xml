   <abstract>[16BY104] Mature female in good condition, extended on back with head to west. Pit from plowzone filled with light colored clay and humus. Bones lay on subsoil. Left leg slightly shifted, appears to have rolled to left leaving caput pointing up, leg lies on lateral side. Almost no other posthumous shifting. Shell hair pins at either mastoid, left one slightly away from skull. Shell beads around neck mainly on left side. Right leg nearly straight, appears bent in drawing becasue of position of patella, to which shot was taken, and right fibula outside tibia. [16BY106] Juvenile female in good condition, extended on back with head to north. Pit from plowzone filled with mixed fairly dark soil. Bones lie directly over 16BY107. Ribs and vertebrae scattered in region of torso. Right arm flexed at elbow away from body. Skull displaced and lipped slightly to the left, rests on occiput. Disturbance of 16BY106 seems to be subsequent to burial and not incident to either burial. These burials may be simultaneous. Left ribs and vertebrae scattered over area of 16BY107 where it is missing; mandible of 16BY106 dropped down from maxilla, but seems to be simple slumping, not disturbance. This disturbance may be by rodents. [16BY107] Adult female in good condition, extended on back with head to north. Pit same as 16BY106. Bones lay directly under 16BY106 on subsoil. Skull of 16BY106 lay on left shoulder of 16BY107. Left scapula, left clavicle, left ribs missing. Probably not disturbed by 106, but simply decayed. Left side of face of 107 in contact with skull of 106 and is missing. Feet about 0.2' higher than pelvis, right foot over left. Vertebrae except for lumbar 3, 4, 5 in poor shape. These two burials may be simultaneous or 16BY106 may be later. Very nearly exactly superimposed.</abstract>
