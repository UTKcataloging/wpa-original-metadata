      <title>50SW1 Gray Farm Site 3SW1, Stewart County, Tennessee. Cross section of Feature 4 showing trench filled with stone. Sq. 10R2. Direction southeast</title>
   </titleInfo>
   <abstract>This feature is a wide continuous wall trench filled with loose rock. The trench encloses an oval area in which 3SW13 cremation was found. The south, east, and west sections of this wall underlie Feature 1 rock wall while the north section is under the side slope of Mound Phase C, thus associating this feature with Phase C. In the central section are four post molds set in pairs at opposite ends of the enclosure. Noted on burial form 3SW13 is a series of large burnt logs lying between these molds and indicating the presence of a long narrow scaffold. The actual use to which this rock-filled trench was put can only be conjectured; however, two points of evidence are helpful: First, at one place in the trench a butt end of a sapling stuck into the rocks and projected inward, Second, lying over the burial for an average depth of ca. 0.2' was a mass of heavily burnt earth. These two factors would indicate a structure of some sort over the central scaffold. The evidence suggests sapling stuck or wedged into the rock trench and sloped to a common apex. Over this dome arrangement was placed a covering of earth. This crematory structure is contemporaneous with Feature 2, Phase C, and it was not until after the burning of the burial had taken place and Phase C Mound was constructed that Feature 1 rock wall was constructed.</abstract>
