   </titleInfo>
   <abstract>[Feature 30] This fire bed is raised 4-1/2" above the floor of Structure 11. It shows two different levels; the first is to the west and is dished out to a depth of 5". The long axis is North-South and is 4' long and 30" wide. The 2nd level is dished out 2" and has the long axis East-West and is 4' long and 25" wide. The clay is burned red and inside the fire pit was charcoal and a few pieces of pottery, and a burned limestone rock. [Feature 11] This structure is underneath Structure 23 by about 1.1' and its East wall is underneath Structure 19 about 6". From the datum readings it is evident that it lies on a lower level than Structure 14 and hence this structure is the earliest one found in Unit 3 of HS1. It is a narrow rectangular structure of irregular proportions since the North end is disproportionatly further east than the South end. It is also somewhat wider at the North end. At the North end and about half way between the two sides was a large fire bed built up 4" above the floor and dished out in the center. Originally, the fire bed was orientated North-South and about 6" deep. At a later time, however, it was filled in and another fire bed built East-West. This latter bed was only dished out about 2" (Feature 30). The North half of the structure floor was covered with a fine layer of sand mixed with clay (the only structure so treated at this site). Above this are many burned areas showing that at least part of the structure was burned. (See Features 33, 35 and 31). 11a is a short partition wall running into the structure from the West wall. 11b is a short row of post molds 3' south of 11a and parallel. Features 13 and 39 are two cache pits while Features 8 and 38 are refuse pits. Throughout the structure are numerous miscellaneous post molds (all marked with a small 11 on the plot). This structure is resting upon the hardpan.</abstract>
