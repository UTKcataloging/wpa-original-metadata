   </titleInfo>
   <abstract>In Level 1 a section of badly disturbed floor and several masses of clay daub showing cane mat impressions have been found. Lying on this floor is a large amount of pottery sherds and an occasional complete or nearly complete pot as well as a number of other artifacts and a fair number of charred roof saplings, some of which have been saved as dendro specimens. At the level the wall or post mold pattern could not be worked out because of the black humus soil. A few sections of the floor had been especially prepared of puddled clay burnt to a yellowish red; however, these sections were badly disturbed and cracked. Over the rest of the area no prepared floor was apparent. Centrally located was a square fire basin well made of puddled clay burnt a brick red. The sides were vertical and rounded at the corners while the bottom was flat. The rim section was apparently level with the floor. The base was 0.6' deep and 2.1' square. Because of the lack of time to complete excavation, the wall pattern could not be worked out.</abstract>
