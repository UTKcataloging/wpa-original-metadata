      <title>215HA3 Hixon Mound Site 1HA3, Hamilton Co., Tennessee. Feature 63, Rectangular structure, and Feature 73, Rectangular, large post structure on Floor P level. Direction northwest</title>
   </titleInfo>
   <abstract>Small closely-set post holes on the ridges are the molds of Feature 63 on the O or upper floor level. The 4 white stakes laid in a rectangle indicate where the rectangular altar (Feature 67) was situated on the old floor level. The large post molds spaced far apart show the level and outline of Feature 73, another structure which was partly under Feature 63 at an average depth of 5/10'. The rectangular altar (Feature 72) was situated on the 4P level in the appropriate center of Feature 70. [Feature 73] This structure was erected of large posts in a rectangular almost square pattern. The posts average about 3.0' apart. A small quantity of charred thatch, cane and some wood lay on the floor over the postmolds in the ESE corner and to the outside of the structure. the trench for the postmolds of Feature 63 were dug from the level of Feature 73 (Floor P), the posts set and the fill between the two floors of Feature 63 and 73 added. This structure is radically different from the others encountered in the mound. However, the central square altar is a familiar feature. [Feature 63] Rectangular structure (Floor O) (Refer also to description of Feature 73). Floor was a partially burned mixture of sand and clay. The trenches were dug and probably the posts were set at the Floor P level of Feature 73 for the superstructure of Feature 63. The intervening fill between the two floor levels was about 0.5' thick on average. The trenches for the N.Northeast and S.Southwest walls showed fairly clearly by soil contrasts. However, the trenches for the other two walls could not be seen by soil contrasts - the existence of a trench could only be ascertained by the manner in which the filling between the postmolds could be cleaned off. Exterior horizontal log molds showed only in the trenches on N.Northeast and east Southeast walls. At least two corners were closed up by large corner posts. One and possibly both of the other two were closed by small postmolds.</abstract>
