   <abstract>[Feature 14] Structure represented by floor, firebasin and postmold pattern. Floor lies just below plowzone and is scored by plow. Floor baked red, upper surface missing in some spots. On floor and in soil above were crumbs of baked clay that appear to have been wattle. Firebasin filled with wattle showing grass impressions. Upper edge of large baisn was plowed away, walls vertical, curve at bottom to flat hard floor. Floor of basin had black upper surface and was burned to depth of 0.35'. Second basin lies to S-E of large basin and is earlier than large basin. Second basin was mostly destroyed and only floor left. No outline of pit of Feature 14 ws found. Post mold pattern seems to indicate a rectangular structure. No evidence of entrance passage. Wattle and ash in firebasin seem to indicate structure was burned. Subsoil very sandy in this region. [Feature 18] Semi-subterranean structure below and precedent to Feature 14. Floor of Feature 14 overlaps pit and floor of Feature 18. Part of pit only could be traced. Pit edge regular in outline and walls vertical. Entrance of three trenches near south corner. Floor was covered with thin layer of greyish mixed sand and clay. This appears to be weathered clay and may represent unburned wattle. Had good cleavage away from floor. Lay in area mainly toward edges and was lacking in small space north of basin and large area SE of basin. No area of floor hard burned and structure apparently not burned. Basin at center circular without curb. Walls nearly vertical and fairly hard. Floor was flat, very hard and burned 0.3' deep. Near NE edge was small piece of limestone on floor, just north of entrance were several pieces of limestone and a river pebble 0.4' dia. in a small hole. NW of firebasin were two shallow pits with flat bottoms and vertical sides. Pits showed no signs of fire. SE of firebasin was small trench 8.5' long. In trench were small but deep post holes, trench semi-circular in vertical cross section. Trench not encountered until floor level reached. May be precedent as it was very shallow as if it had been partly cut away by structure.</abstract>
