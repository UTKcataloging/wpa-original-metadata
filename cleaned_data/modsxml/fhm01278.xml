      <title>238MG31 Hiwassee Island Site 46MG31, Meigs County, Tennessee. 46MG31 - Mound. Pile of mussel shell over Burial 46MG53. Note how shell dips toward the center. This is probably due to post mortem shifting and decay. Square 6R1. Direction north</title>
   </titleInfo>
   <abstract>It can hardly be said that the burial is in a pit, although the sunken bed of shell gives that appearance. What is more likely is that after the body had been placed a number of mussel shells was heaped over it. As the flesh decayed, however, the shells sank down over the body so that instead of a rounded heap it is now concave in form. This is made the more probable since no evidence of a pit having been dug was apparent. On either side of the burial were placed large logs. Nothing remains of these except a charred line the width of the logs. It is apparent that the logs were burnt, but nothing of a fire is apparent with the burial itself, or with the artifacts. The burial itself is nearly extended. The bone is very red in color contrasting the rest of the burial found to date. The burial is in Mound Phase C. The skull, however, rose into Phase B. Thus one would suspect that the burial had been placed on the very top of Phase C and covered with material of Phase B. Apparently the burial associates with Phase C.</abstract>
