      <title>MF17 John Ausmus Farm Site 2CE10, Claiborne County, Tennessee. Mound 1, Fourth floor level. Feature 42, Primary floor and structure (note other holes in the hardpan have been blanked out. Compare with photo 10-519)</title>

   <abstract>[Feature 40] Whether the outline on the accompanying diagram is the correct one for the secondary structure depends on which molds are given to the primary structure. If the primary structure is the large one as given on that sheet, all that can safely be said to belong to the secondary structure is the line of molds just south of the clay platform or sheet Feature 41. If the primary structure is given by the smaller figures on that feature sheet, this would allow a complete secondary structure, i.e., the one given on the accompanying diagram. [Feature 42] In square 10.6. Pit 1.4' deep, 1.4' diameter. Unusual in that it had a clay cellar 3" above floor level. The post mold outline of this structure on account of the great profusion of post molds could not be determined with accuracy. The accompanying diagram shows two possible solutions for the problem presented by the post mold arrangement. The diagram of this structure should be carefully compared with the diagram of the secondary structure, Feature 40. The holes in red on the accompanying diagram appeared to be double, i.e., a larger hole, with a smaller hole inside. There was a definite soil demarkation in these double holes. Also there was a marked difference in hardness of the two colors of soil. The molds indicated in brown on the diagram may possibly be the northern end of the primary structure. If this is true it would allow a complete secondary structure. The first figures given in the dimensions are those for the larger structure, the second for the smaller structure.</abstract>
