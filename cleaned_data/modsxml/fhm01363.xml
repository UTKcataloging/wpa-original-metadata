      <title>48MN3 Mouse Creek Site 4MN3, McMinn County, Tennessee. Feature 9, Hearth, and stone metate, the latter lay beneath the plowzone and probably had not ben disturbed since the evacuation of the house. Note tilted surface of metate. Direction southwest</title>

   <abstract>At the right of the fireplace is a flat stone with two depressions. The raised area around the fireplace was burned; roots probably account for the destruction of the portion of the rim of the hearth. [Feature 9] The house was located close to the creek bank which is quite heavily grown in trees and shrubs. For this reason it was not considered feasible to remove this growth and excavate over the break of the bank. Thus the north end of the house was not excavated. Since the house was apparently considerably longer than wide probably 1/4 of the house was not excavated. The humus accumulation over the house was relatively thick (average 1.5' - 2.0') and the entire area penetrated by numerous roots. Irregular, scattered remnants of a pit outline were apparent -- but the pit was quite shallow with no suggestion of vertical walls. In general the extent of the house was determined by the post molds. The floor of the house was slightly depressed. Two fire basins were in the floor of the house. One in the northwest end is discussed as Feature 11. The other occupied the approximate center of the structure. It was a moderately shallow basin -- bowl shaped with a rather low, rounded curbing of puddled clay circular in aspect. The curbing was 0.1' - 0.2' above the general floor level, and 0.3 above the bottom of the basin. A large quantity of grass, cane, and wood impressed wattle lay over the center of the house 0.3' - 0.5' above the floor and separated from the floor by a thin layer of loose black humic soil. Other scattered patches of wattle lay outside the central mass of wattle. The entry trenches in the characteristic shape (n) penetrated the southeast wall near the south corner. Fairly extensive areas of compacted, burned clay surrounding Feature 11 and the central fire basin were recognizable as floor. These merged with the general unburned compacted floor. The remainder of the floor was compacted and of mottled hue -- the post molds fairly distinct where root disturbances did not interfere. The actual "fill" of the shallow house area was characteristically mixed -- the thick humic band above, however, which bore the interferring vegetation was comparatively sterile and a uniform black in color. This house appears abberant in its dimensions, however, it may not have been a great deal longer from northwest to southeast thus minimizing its oblong appearance. There is a faint suggestion of an orderly pattern for the interior post molds of the structure -- however, the observer may draw his own conclusions by referring to the large scale plot.</abstract>
