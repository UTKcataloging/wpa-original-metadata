      <title>165HA2 Davis Site 6HA2, Hamilton Co., TN. Feature 1, Double fire basin. Feature 5, Stone cist burial and Feature 11, Post mold pattern showing fire basin. Direction southwest</title>
   </titleInfo>
   <abstract>[Feature 1] These fire basins were found at the east end of structure F.11 and their rims were .3' above the top of the wall trench of the structure. The two basins were next to each other with the long axis E.W. On the east end a small apron-like area had been added to the basin. These two basins were as close to the top of the surface that the plow had disturbed the rim of the west basin. [Feature 11] This structure is of notable interest because of the 4 large fire places, 2 at either end. Near the center was a burial pit in which burial 6HA2 was found. (Feature 5) This structure was just below the plow line and over part of it was a foundation for a shed that stood there in historic times. This structure appears to lie on a wash from the Tertiary Mound to the North. [Feature 5] This is the first stone cist found in this excavation. See burial data form 6HA2. [Burial 6HA2] 6HA2 lies in a rectangular cist of limestone slabs (Feature 5). The sides of the cist are formed of slabs set on edge. Four long, narrow slabs were laid across the slabs which form the sides, and above these were laid a number of additional flat rocks which served to seal the crevices.</abstract>
