   <titleInfo>
      <title>62MG31 Hiwassee Island Site 37MG31, Meigs County, Tennessee. 37MG31 - Earth mound. Feature 24, Level C. Floor pattern delineated by wall trenches and postmolds. Small fire basin may be seen at left center. Direction east</title>
   </titleInfo>
   <abstract>This structure lies directly under Feature 20 and is in all respects similar although not quite as large. It is outlined by post molds set in wall trenches and with open corners. No corner posts found. The fire basin is very small, being 0.3' deep, 0.6' wide and made of puddled clay baked red. It was filled with ash and charcoal. Two pits found on the floor. The wall posts were vertical giving no indication of having been under any strain that would tend to shift them from their original position. The wall trenches were filled with earth and showed no indication of having had horizontal support logs placed in them. The absence of corner posts leaves the method of closing the corners on the superstructure conjectural. Cane mats or entwining light poles may have been used. The pits found on the floor were regular in shape, but had nothing of interest in them and probably were cache pits from which all destructible material had rotted leaving nothing but black earth.</abstract>
