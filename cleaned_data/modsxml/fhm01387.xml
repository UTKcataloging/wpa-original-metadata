      <title>18PK1 Ocoee Site 2PK1, Polk County, Tennessee. Showing entrance of Feature 1 (Palisade) and Feature 5, large pit in foreground. This is at the southeast corner of the site and palisade. Sq. 25R15. Direction southwest</title>
   </titleInfo>
   <abstract>[Feature 5] A deep conical pit which tapered to a round bottom - had layers of black and yellow fill mingled with animal bone refuse, shell fragments and potsherds. There was an attempt to segregate pottery in four-inch layers but this was abandoned due to great mixture of both shell, grit and sand temper. Animal bone and shell was fragmentary. The palisade was intrusive to this pit and an outline at the plowline showed very plainly. The pit lay on a badly eroded slope and topsoil was only 0.5 deep. Pit outline showed at plowline. [Feature 1] This feature was encountered on the second day of excavation, on the 20-line in the first exploratory trench entered on the site. It appeared to be a trench about 6" average in width, and 6" to 8" in depth, and ran diagonally across square 20R5. Identification is not positive at first because of a lack of post hole pattern in the horizontal profile. It was not until the trench was bisected vertically and longitudinally through the center that any post hole pattern showed. ... Excavation of this feature was continued in a five foot trench until it reached a dead end on the SE corner. Excavation was then carried out both ways at right angles to the palisade, and thus a gate was exposed about five feet wide between inner wall and overlapping outer wall. ... Almost all of the area excavated at site 2PK1 lay within the area inclosed by the palisade.</abstract>
