   </titleInfo>
   <abstract>To the right of the entrance is a row of postmolds denoting the position of a clay daubed partition. At the edge of the bench is seen the lines of another partition. One charred post of this partition extends above the bench level in the center of the photograph. [Feature 20] Bench forming peripheral portion of Feature 14. This bench forms the outer portion of Feature 14, serving as a bench or couch surrounding the central floor and fireplace. It is unbroken except for entrance corridor on south edge is rounded and molded. Built on a framework of canes in usual daub manner. When found ws covered with grass. (See sketch of Fea. 14). [Feature 14] This structure formed base of mound. Over it was fill and rubble. Just above the feature and lying on the floor was charred roof and wall material and fragments from daubed walls. Has an entrance on south and east. [Feature 21] Deposit of mussel shells scraped up to make pit in which Feature 14 was built. Had no bearing on Feature 14 incidental to it. [Feature 22] Is an integral part of Feature 14. Deep fire basin modelled rim, .6' wide and 0.3' high, with puddled clay lining over entire bottom. Contained some ash and roof material when found. [Feature 23] Four and possibly 5 compartments were build on the bench. These had fallen and crumbled so that their original height is unknown. The maximum width of one, which lies on its side, was 1.8, but the top was there, so this gives only a minimum width.</abstract>
