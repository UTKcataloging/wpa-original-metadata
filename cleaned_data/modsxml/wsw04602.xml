      <title>102BE3, 15BE3, Boone County, Kentucky. Robbins Large Mound Site. Aerial View of BE3 and BE14 (the large and small Robbins Mounds)</title>
   </titleInfo>
   <abstract>A photographic copy, taken from the aerial maps of the Soil Conservation Service, of the immediate area surrounding BE3 and BE14 on the Robert R. Robbins farm. The physiographic character (highly dissected) of this area is evident in the photograph ... the only cleared area in bluegrass are the relatively smooth hilltops; the steep hillsides, washes and gullies are all grown up in brush. Note the rough rectangular area in the center of the photograph that is spotty. This is the apple orchard on the Robbins farm. The farmstead building are located at the north end of this orchard and a small tobacco barn at the south end of it. A dirt roadway runs the long axis if the orchard between these buildings. One third of the distance between these two buildings, going south, going south in the orchard and on the right of the roadway note the interruption of the otherwise uniform orchard floor ... this is the large mound BE3. The dark area to the north of the mound is the shadow cast by the mound with the sun in the southwest. The dirt roadway appears as a suggestion veering to the left south of the tobacco barn. Note the white spot in this lespedeza field just beyond where this faintly indicated road disappears ... this is BE14. The white appearance is probably due to scanty vegetation because of the infertility of the "made" mound fill. See reverse of photograph for definitely marked locations of two mounds ... hold up to light. Careful examination of the large mound (BE3) will show a definite pit in its surface. This is the large open crater left by the "white" pot-holers and identified in the field notes as Feature #21.</abstract>
