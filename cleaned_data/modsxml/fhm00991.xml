      <title>208HS12 Patterson Site 70HS12, Humphreys County, Tennessee. House 5, post mold structure. No wall trench used. Central fire basin. Large fire basin in southwest corner belongs to an earlier house. Note east coor. trench in background</title>
   </titleInfo>
   <abstract>[Structure 5] This house is the topmost structure of Summit B and was formed of regular rows of medium sized posts with square corners. No wall trench was used. Two pits, one at the NE corner and one at the SW corner broke into the post mold pattern and were considerably later than the structure. At the SW corner the posts went through a large dire basin, Feature 12, which preceded the house. Centrally located is a small fire basin without a curb, however, it seems necessary to hold this point in abeyance since it seems clear that this structure was cleaned over after its destruction. Basis for this observation is that while almost the entire floor showed evidence of having been accidentally burned i.e. as a result of the of the building burning, no logs, saplings or house debris of any kind was found. This seems to indicate a levelling of the house site before Phase A construction started. This process could have cut off a curb to the fire basin. However, it is to be remembered that no fire basin encountered on either Summit A or B has showed any sign of having a curb.</abstract>
