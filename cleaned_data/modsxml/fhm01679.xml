      <title>3SW1 Gray Farm Site 1SW1, Stewart County, Tennessee. Burials 1SW1, 1SW3, showing infant stone graves before removal of top slab. Inclusive to Level 2. 1SW3 (subsoil). Sq. 2L14. Direction west</title>
   </titleInfo>
   <abstract>[Burial 1] This stone grave was uniformly shaped of flat limestone slabs varying in diameters of a minimum of about 0.6' to a maximum of about 1.0'. The grave had stones on its six sides and the skeleton was deposited about centrally on the stone bottom of the box. The side and end stones still retained their vertical placement and there was little posthumous shifting except on top, where the top slabs had dropped slightly. The head and chest region rested on three flat stones of the bottom, and the pelvis and legs lay on three stones that overlapped, forming an irregular surface to the lower section of the floor of the box. The bottom of the grave rested at the bottom of the second 6" level. There was no pit to suggest the burial was intrusive. The top of the grave just about extended into the plow zone, but no apparent damage resulted from cultivation above. [Burial 3] This stone grave was constructed of flat limestone slabs and thin shale, the latter forming the end and bottom stones and one piece incorporated in a side. The burial appeared to have been disturbed and was very incomplete, there being only a crunched skull and long bones. It was deposited on the flat shale stone that formed the bottom. Disturbance of the burial may have been due to rodents. The end stone at the feet had fallen over and there was only a single large cover stone. Two small stones formed props for one of the sides and end stones.</abstract>
