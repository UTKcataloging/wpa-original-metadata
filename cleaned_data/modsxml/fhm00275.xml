      <title>216BY13 Ledford Island Site 16BY13, Bradley Co., TN. Profile 3' west of L2 line between 2 and 4 lines showing typical section of Feature 17. Square 2L2 - 4L2. Direction east</title>

   <abstract>[Feature 17] [Feature 17] Feature 17 is a large trench into subsoil, filled with humic dark soil. It is apparently a continuation of Feature 7 which stops at 5.0W 5.0N of 2R1. There is a gap of about twelve feet between the west end of Feature 7 and the last end of Feature 17. The side walls of Feature 17 are straight and lightly sloping inward. The bottom is very nearly flat. The regularity of wall and floor in profile of Feature 17 leads to the assuption that it is man made. It arises at the base of the thick occupational deposits below the plowzone. In the region of Feature 17 excavated, it was overlain by Feature 26 so that no adequate knowledge of its origin can be determined. However, the extreme eastern end did seem to be fill of Feature 26, and here the trench appeared to arise at the base of the humus zone. See Feature 27 (profile) for discussion of the humic zone above Feature 17. Feature 17 was filled with a homogenous dark grey fill. This appeared to be a true humus development. Very few lenses of disturbed earth were observed. At the bottom and extending up the sides a short distance a mottled and leached band was found. This was composed of two thin layer of disturbed yellow clay separated by a humic band.... The trench probably extends farther to the west but growing crops made it inadvisable to extend the excavations further. [Feature 34] West end midden deposit to south and southwest of 10 L 8 stake. This feature is an extensive midden deposit that extends at least 200 ft west of western limit of excavation. It probably is an area of occupation that has suffered less erosion than has the portion of the site to the east. A trench was dug into it and it generally retained a midden character with some intrusion, postholes etc. There were a few burials lying in the midden.</abstract>
