      <title>47MG31 Hiwassee Island Site 37MG31, Meigs County, Tennessee. 37MG31 - Earth mound. Cross-section of post molds of north wall. Note inward inclination of these molds. In opposite side of cut are the vertical molds belonging to Feature 10. Sq. 7L2. Direction west</title>
   </titleInfo>
   <abstract>[Feature10] This structure lies directly over another (Feat. 11) and is delineated by small deep post molds very close together with the four corners left open (i.e. no molds found in corners). All the molds are vertical in cross-section, but many of them are not truly round in diameter. No historical material has been found with the structure but there are indications that Level B, on which this structure was built, was in use at least in early historical times. The fire basin was directly under the basin for Feat. 9 and hence is considerably destroyed; however it is centrally located, made of puddled clay with the top level with the structure floor. The molds in the S.E. corner were destroyed by an intrusive pit that came down from the top of the mound. Log molds were found for this dwelling after the upper part had been cut away. At the bottom of the molds were logs laid the length of the trench. Only charred fragments were found of the logs and in places the bark impressions on the ground was all that showed. The log molds were outside of the post mold pattern. The log molds, in a sense, are similar to wall trenches, however with this important difference, that they were not used to aid in setting the wall posts but simply to introduce some support for the posts at the extreme basal end. This would seem to indicate that the wall posts were subjected to some strain. However, it is to be noted that there were no apparent arrangements on the inside of the posts to help counteract a strain. Possibly a log laid above ground at the base of the posts was used. The wide open corners show no indication as to how they were closed on the superstructure.</abstract>
