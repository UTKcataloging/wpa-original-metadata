      <title>19SW1 Gray Farm Site 1SW1, Stewart Co., TN. Feature 42, Structure delineated by wall trenches with open corners. Structure in subsoil, but pit originated at top of Level 5. Horizontal log molds along inner side of wall molds in upper section of trenches. Top Level 5. Sq. 11L9. Direction north</title>

   <abstract>Only the center post mold apparently associates, probably roof support. Small circular fire basin slightly away from center. Also clay seat situated off center at south wall of structure. [Feature 42] This pit house was built on the earliest cultural horizon by digging a pit 0.9' into subsoil and within this area constructing an open-cornered wall trench type of structure. No corner posts were used. The floor was of hard, consolidated subsoil clay but showed no evidence of having been burnt. The side wall posts of the superstructure were very small, evenly spaced ca. 1' apart and reinforced by a horizontal log mold at the top of the wall trench on the inside of the posts. None were used at the bottom of the trench. Centrally located was a very shallow, crudely-made fire basin of burnt, puddled clay. It was 1.1' in diameter and 0.2' deep. The sides sloped inward somewhat while the bottom was fairly flat. There was no indication of an entrance; however, on the south wall somewhat east of the center was a clay seat of subsoil earth. This was apparently constructed at the time the pit was dug for the house by the simple procedure of leaving a block of subsoil in place and cutting it down, then, to the proper shape. This seat was almost square in shape, being 2.6' wide and 0.5' high. Centrally located was a large, deep post mold that in all probability was used as a central roof support. There is very little evidence of superstructure form; however, it is to be noted that, aside from the use of a pit area, the ground pattern is very similar to that of the common open-cornered wall trench type.</abstract>
