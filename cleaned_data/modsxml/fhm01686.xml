      <title>15SW1 Gray Farm Site 1SW1, Stewart Co., TN. Feature 28. Photo shows post mold pattern and burnt clay floor structure which was also delineated by wall trenches with tapering ends and open corners. The wall trenches did not show since they were not found until the floor was cut through. Level 3. Sq. 3L11. Direction west-northwest</title>

   <abstract>Small circular fire basin not found until after the photograph was taken. Burned material on the floor is charred corn stalks, wood, reeds, and some cane, apparently part of the superstructure which burned. Part of the wall trench near the camera lies in subsoil in bottom of Ash Pit #1. Artifacts scattered on floor: Broken pot FS 611, Smoothing stone FS 612, Chipped blade FS 621, Chipped axe FS 622, Broken pot FS 618, Bone awl FS 613. [Feature 28] This structure is delineated by a wall trench in which were regularly placed post molds ca. 0.6' apart and located in the center of the trench. The posts were vertical in cross section and since no log molds were found in the trenches, they received no bracing in the trench. The floor was purposefully prepared of a sandy clay earth puddled and spread over the area. This was probably fired, however, the firing was relatively light and did little more than redden the surface. Lying over the floor to a depth of ca. 0.2' was a mass of loose earth burnt to a bright red: this was the daub used on the exterior of the dwelling. Under this was a fragmentary amount of charred saplings and crude matting of cane splits. A fire basin located near the center was made of puddled clay burnt a dark red. This basin was circular, ca. 1.1' in diameter, had no raised rim, and was 0.3' deep. On the north side of the structure was a large cache pit (pit 43) 5' long, 3.5' wide and 1.2' deep. It was filled with the burnt material from the roof which contained sherds and animal bone. In some areas the burnt material on the floor looked more like corn stalks than cane, leading one to believe that the material had been used to form mats. At the NW corner, the gap between the ends of the trench is considerably wider than usual and is not blocked by a corner post, but at the ends of the trench and outside of them were post molds. This probably formed the entrance to the structure.</abstract>
