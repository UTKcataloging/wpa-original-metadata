   <abstract>House number 7. [Feature 7] This structure is of the "Pit House" type, although the pit seems to have originated at a point only 0.5' above the floor; it may be, however, that this was more apparent than actual since above this point an excessive amount of midden material made it impossible to see such an outline. It is more than probable that after the abandonment of this house the "pit" was used as a place to dispose of refuse and hence a pile of midden material accumulated over the dwelling in the pit and probably, since the precedent was established, the area continued as a dump after the pit was filled up. The floor of this structure was rather indefinite and badly disturbed by intrusive post molds and pits. The firebasin was damaged by the workmen, however sufficient evidence remains to determine all of the characteristics. There was no evidence of burning and hence no superstructure evidence is available. The entrance was probably at the NW corner where a wide opening was left between the corner posts at the ends of the wall trenches.</abstract>
