      <title>134BY13 Ledford Island, Bradley Co., TN. Feature 14, Showing post molds, fire basin and inclusive burial (52BY16) pit at right. Square 0R1, etc. Direction north</title>
   </titleInfo>
   <abstract>Semi-subterranean structure with central fire basin though only northern part could be traced. Pit could be traced from about 0.2' below plowzone and may well have extended to the plowzone. Earth of fill very black. Along north edge of pit were scattered small areas of yellow sandy clay; occasional very small pieces of this yellow sandy clay scattered throughout the fill of the pit. Floor somewhat compacted around the fire basin but not burned, and it could not be traced with any certainty. Fire basin incenter somewhat ovoid without curb. Walls and floor of hard puddled clay. Walls burned red 0.1' thick; floor red 0.2' deep. Walls slope inward and bottom is rounded. Basin filled with compact grey ash. Near the NE corner were two small piles of burned material on the floor, so badly decayed that identification was impossible, but it seemed to be cane. Near the E side two trenches were discovered below what had been considered the floor level. They seem to be inside the house, but are perhaps an entrance passage. Burial 16BY51 was an infant in the top of a post hold, probably inclusive. 16BY52 ws an infant in an oval pit, rectangular at the bottom. The pit showed first at floor level and pit is probably inclusive in structure. House seems to be aligned N-S, but edge of pit was unsatisfactory and post mold pattern seems to be erratic....</abstract>
