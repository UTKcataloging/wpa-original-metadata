   <abstract>[30SW116] Seems to have been placed on 30SW116A and subsequent to it. 30SW116A is badly disturbed and full top out of place. [30SW138] Complete cist. There is considerable doubt as to which bones belong to 30SW138 and 138A. The skull 30SW138A was once considered belonging to the legs of 30SW138 and 138 was given to a heap of bones in the middle. The bone is packed this way. However, there is a fair likelihood that the skull and arms of 138A are extra bones and precedent to everything else. The bone will have to be matched up in the laboratory. [30SW137] Full top, side, bottom, and end slabs. This burial was in good order. The ribs are somewhat tangled, and hands and feet are scattered. Rodents (?) have dragged both fibulae so that they lie diagonally beneath the right femur and tibia lying over the vertebrae, one end touching the chin, is an antler handle (?). Between left arm and ribs is a large polished piece of limestone, celt-like in shape but flat edged all the way around. Over the thorassic vertebrae and slumped to the right was an irregular thin piece of limestone. This underlay several ribs. This is of doubtful significance, since the stone may have split off the top and dropped and slid through the ribs. [30SW99] Top side, end, and bottom slabs present. Somewhat disturbed with left humerus lying over vertabrae and disarticulated from lower arm. It is thought that 30SW99 displaced 30SW102 (represented by scraps of skull on North side of North side slabs). Bottom slabs seem to run out of cist towards North. [30SW127] Scattered fragments were all that remained. Cist complete except for missing top. [30SW132] Complete top, bottom, side, and end slabs present. Probably the bone has just rotted away.</abstract>
