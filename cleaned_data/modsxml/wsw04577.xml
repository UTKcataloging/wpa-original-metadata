      <title>77BE3, 15BE3, Boone County, Kentucky. Robbins Large Mound Site. The 125' Profile</title>
   </titleInfo>
   <abstract>Photograph taken from the north of the subject. This photograph of a profile on the north side of the mound was taken during the spring of 1940 when the entire marginal skirt of the mound had been removed leaving a large central block of irregular proportions. The foreground block on the left is a portion of the 125-130' section and supports the part of Tomb #11 ( Feature #12) lying in that section. The vertical structural data related to this tomb is exposed on the "backdrop" dipping loads of the earth roof which had collapsed into the tomb cavity, and the walls on either side of this cavity. The small foreground block on the right supports a part of the tomb #12 (Feature #6) which lay in the 125-130' section. The vertical evidence of this tomb in the background 125' face was very scanty, only very faint evidence of loads dipping into the tomb cavity being evident. Because of this very poor evidence a portion of this tomb has been cut away in the 125-130' section thus exposing the tomb floor in the profile as well as the log mold (indicated by the round circle). The tomb floor showed no bark profile. The upper band in the profile is a highly leached, homogeneous yellow grey silty loam comprised of a great deal of washed earth from higher portions of the mound surface. The second band on the profile from the top is of a mottled yellow, grey, and brown earth with occasional scattered loads. The roof earth of the two tombs appeared to be common between them and showed moderately distinct loading with much mixed earth intermixed with the loading. Likewise the two tombs had a common wall between them, but the continuation of the fill of the west wall of Tomb #11 beneath Tomb #12, in what appears an altered form, suggest the priority of the former over the latter. It may well be that the outer edge of the west wall of Tomb #11 was either cut out or built up to provide the adequate wall for Tomb #12.</abstract>
