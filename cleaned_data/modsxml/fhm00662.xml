      <title>9-180 Harris Farm Site 5CP9, Campbell County, Tennessee. Mound 1. Post mold structure on floor of mound</title>
   </titleInfo>
   <abstract>A rectangular structure located on floor of mound 27' 8" E.W., 24' 6" N.S. Post molds were numerous both inside this structure and throughout the floor. No evidence of fireplace within the rectangular structure. In the face of this cut in center of mound 35' north of the south end of mound the line of posts was evident running north and south on east end of structure. A difference in nature of soil, within and without - on east end of mound was noticed. Within the structure the soil was darker and mixed with more charcoal, red and yellow clay; outside the line of post molds was a yellowish and brown clay, which seemed to have been piled against the outside of structure which was later filled in. On west end of this structure the post molds slanted to west about six inches above floor. A large bed of ashes was located on floor of mound 42' north of south end of mound, it measured 15' N.S. and 39' E.W. and was composed of shells, broken pottery, arrow points, shell spoons, ashes and charcoal and was about 9" thick. A small bed of ashes was found in southwest corner of mound 1. Horizontal log molds were found on outside of post holds on south side of structure. This mold was about 3" in diameter and 3" above base of vertical post holes.</abstract>
