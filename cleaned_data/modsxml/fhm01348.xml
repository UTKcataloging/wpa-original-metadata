      <title>12MN3 Mouse Creek Site 3MN3, McMinn County, Tennessee. Feature 12, Depressed floor of a dwelling house. Sq. 16L19. Direction northwest</title>
   </titleInfo>
   <abstract>Semi-subterranean structure; walls nearly vertical but slightly irregular. Plowline appeared to dip down over pit, being higher outside pit. North corner of pit was very faint. South corner was cut away in approach. Wood was mainly small beams, some of which appeared to be split; though this may have been due to decay. Beams lay mostly at right angles to each other. Many of the beams were very small. Under beams and directly on floor were remains of canes. They seemed to be whole canes but no weaving pattern could be found. Floor seemed to be covered with very thin coat of detritus (1/2). Floor was sandy subsoil and showed weak cleavage. Post molds very shallow. At SE side was a very shallow pit that showed no signs of intrusion but may have been precedent. North of hearth was shallow pit with very irregualr bottom. In center of structure was small burned area. This was not burned hard and was extremely hard to clear beause of its softness. It may be that this represents location of fire. In center of burned area was a small shallow hole (0.5'). This may be firebasin but did not seem to be burned to any extent. It was filled with black charred material. In center of NE side just outside pit was pile of 17 cracked river pebbles. They lay 0.5' above floor level. The upper part of this structure was undoubtedly plowed away to some extent so that present depth does not represent original condition.</abstract>
