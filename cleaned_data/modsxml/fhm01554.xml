      <title>48RE12 DeArmond Site 2RE12, Roane Co., TN. Feature 32, Circular pit filled with stone and associated with lower "old humus" band. Photo provides north-northeast - south-southeast cross section view; outline of section removed etched in ground. Datum 9.6' (Top of pit). Sq. 37R2. Direction north-northwest</title>

   <abstract>This pit was more or less circular in shape and seemed to originate at the top of the old humus band (which is hard compact clay) present in the east side of the site. The pit was filled with a large number of alluvial sandstones and chert, many of which were fire-cracked and stained black. Under the stone and intermixed with it were flecks of charcoal and reddish burned clay. One large piece of clay (about 0.15' in diameter and 0.1' thick) apparently had been squeezed into a compact mass. This clay mass ws fired black on one side and ranged to yellow on the other. A couple of flint chips were found and only one sherd, the first piece of pottery to have been found in this lower humus band. This sherd apparently was cord-marked in some manner - but a careful examination was not attempted due to its fragile state. It seemed to be sand-tempered - but this is a tentative analysis only. This pit lay rather close to Feature 23, the large bed of mussel shell also associated with this "old humus" band. Another bed of alluvial stone associated with the band was not far away, being somewhat to the southeast of this feature. It was from this bed that two flint projectile points were found earlier in the excavation. It might be said that cultural evidence has been exceedingly scant on this "old humus" band, but that enough evidence has been encountered to show that there has been some aboriginal occupation - the extent of which, with the present information, would be more or less conjecture. Geologically, this band or zone is the oldest yet encountered in the excavated area south of the mound (3RE12).</abstract>
