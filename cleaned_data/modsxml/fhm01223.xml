   <abstract>[Feature 42] This small structure lies on the lowest section of Level E to the West of all other features. It is delineated by a post mold pattern of small evenly spaced molds on the East and North sides but very irregular on the South. The West side was destroyed by the West Coordinate Trench. Apparently no specially prepared floor was used, but there are several burnt patches and considerable charred fragments of wood and grass on the floor. Not enough to give any evidence of a superstructure, however. On the floor on the Southeast corner is a considerable mass of unworked mussel shell. On the outside of the post molds was a log mold (along East section of North wall) averaging 0.2' deep , 0.5' wide and filled with decayed and charred log. [Feature 40A and B] For purposes of discussion Feature 40 will be divided into subfeatures A and B. Feature 40A is the earth bank to the left of the C.A. surrounding Feature 41 while Feature 40B is the right of C.A. surrounding Feature 43. This earth bank (both sections) was built up by placing a very heavy layer of earth against the side walls of Features 41-43 extending from the roof to the side slope of Level E, mound phase, overlapping the side slope evenly and in such a way as to give the appearance that the side slope of the mound continued up to the roof of the two structure mentioned. Since the roofs of the two structures were apparently covered with earth the effect was to give the two structures the appearance of rather large mounds of earth to the north of Features 39 and 38 respectively. When these two structures fell the result was to somewhat scatter this heavy load of earth and weathering caused it to round off over the post mold pattern. On the south side some of the earth fell on the north edge of the two pyramid mounds Features 38 and 39. Then Feature 40A overlies the north edge of the floor on top of Feature 39 mound and Feature 40B overlay a considerable part of Feature 38 mound including some of it over the platform 38A. Under the two sections of these earth banks postmold patterns have been found for the two above mentioned structures. Feature 40B is on a higher elevation than Feature 40A since it associates with the Feature 38 pyramid mound and the somewhat lower floor to the north Feature 43. Feature 40A, on the lower level associates with Feature 39 pyramid mound. and the somewhat lower floor Feature 41. Feature 40B has an average dd of 15.1' on the top of the ridge with a variation of 1.6' while 40A has an average dd of 17.4 and a variation of 1.3' along the top of the ridge. dd (down 10') cross section through Feature 40. See profile drawing on original sheet. This profile shows the earth bank for the two structures. The underneath mottled grey clay was the earth laid up against the wall of Feature 44 structure (below Feature 41) while the above sandy humic soil in Feature 40 was laid up against the side slope of Feature 41. This situation is duplicated for Features 43 and 47. In removing Feature 40 the original side slope of pyramid mounds 38 and 39 to floor 41 and 43 respectively is apparent. [Feature 39] This pyramid mound is in the Southwest section of Level E. The South slope is very steep and runs from a D.D. of 17.5' to a D.D. of 23' at bottom. The slope has an incline of Ca. 80 degrees. The East slope forms the junction with Feat. 38 mound with the ramp 38c and 39c connecting the two at the Northeast corner of the mound. The North slope is very sharp, being almost vertical but dropping only Ca. 1.5' to a terrace (Feat. 41 floor). On the West side the slope is rather sharp for a drop of Ca. 2' in a horizontal distance of 6'. In the next 6', it levels out almost flat before the final drop to the outer edge of Level E. On the south side slope just west of the mound proper, are a number of toe holds on the side slope. These lead up to the flat area. then on the southwest corner of the mound on the first steep slope a crude step has been built and below this another small leg mold. It would appear that this arrangement is a sort of secondary approach to the top of the mound. On the South slope of this mound slightly East of the center point is a very well made ramp (39B) with well defined steps out into it. On the top is a flat area 25' x 17' and somewhat East of the center is a very well made clay platform (Feat. 39A). In back of the seat is a row of post molds running across the width of the mound. At the extreme west end is another such row. This would indicate that some sort of canopy was placed over the seat. Feature 40 lies over the north section of the mound surface. The floor was well made and possibly hardened by fire, although this may have been accidentally done when Feature 41 burned. [Feature 39A] This platform is made of hard-packed yellow, sandy clay. The surface was smoothed and burnt dark red. The platform is raised 1.5' above the surface of the mound and is located somewhat East of the center point. The back of the platform was built up against a row of postmolds and consequently is vertical. On the other 3 sides, the bottom is somewhat farther out than the top. Twelve feet in front of the seat is another row of post molds parallel to those in back of the seat and in all probability they formed supports for a canopy over the platform. [Feature 38] This pyramidal mound lies in the Southeastern section of Level E. The South and East sides are very steeply sloped and run from a top D.D. of around 15' to a base reading of Ca. 22'. The North side slopes down sharply Ca. 1.5' to a terrace (i.e. Feat. 43). On the West, the slope is pronouncedly sharp to a D.D. of Ca. 17.5' where this pyramid mound joins Feat. 39 pyramid mound. On this side, these two mounds are joined by a ramp (Feat. 38c-39c). On the south slope, a well made stairway ramp gives an approach to the top of the mound. On top of the mound is a large flat area 38' x19' showing some evidence of burning. Red patches and a slight amount of charred material indicating a fairly well made floor. Slightly west of the center in a large platform case (Feature 38A) upon which some notable probably sat. In the north side of this platform is a row of 7 P.M. but no others appear on the other side of the platform. A few misc. P.M.s are to be found but they don't form any pattern. From the evidence it must be assumed that neither this pyramid mound nor the top area and possibly not even the platform were protected by any overhead shelter but were left open to the weather. It is remarkable that little or no errosion or weathering is apparent. Feature 40 lies over the north half of the mound and also over a good part of the platform. Correction note: The row of 7 postmolds mentioned above were later found to run under the platform. Further another row was found at the east end and parallel to this one. About 1' west of this row a wall trench was found, but no post molds found in it. A short row of molds back of the platform parallels these other rows. These molds were not found until this level had been cut down ca. .3'. The indication is that this pyramid mound was used for a period before the platform was built. Then the platform was built and the molds in back of the platform and the wall mold at the east end were used for the erection of a shelter over it. The other two parallel rows were used for a similar purpose before the platform was built. [Feature 38A] This platform is made of hard-packed sandy, mottled grey clay and the surface had been baked hard and smooth. The platform is raised 1.4 above the floor of the mound Feature 38 and is somewhat west of the center point being ca. 3' farther west than the ramp. This platform apparently was not under a shelter but exposed to the weather. That it shows no sign of weathering may be due to the fact that a skin of some sort was kept over it. Feature 40 overlay the entire north half of the feature to a thickness of ca. 0.5'. Correction note: Further excavation indicates that a shelter had been built over the top area of the pyd. mound Feature 38 similar to the one noted for pyramidal mound Feature 39. [Feature 39B] This ramp is made of very hard-packed sandy clay and runs from the base of Level E to the top of Feat. 39 pyramidal mound at an angle of Ca. 45 degrees. The top surface has been cut into fairly regular, well made steps. The ramp fans out slightly at the base so that it is wider than at the top. The ramp shows no evidence of patching or of erosion although it was exposed to the weather. This ramp forms the main approach to Feat. 39 pyramidal mound.</abstract>
