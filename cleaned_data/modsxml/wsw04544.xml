      <title>44BE3, 15BE3, Boone County, Kentucky. Robbins Large Mound Site. The 65' Profile</title>
   </titleInfo>
   <abstract>Photograph taken from the south of the subject. Indicated in the foreground profile of the 65' face incised to emphasize structural divisions. The background profile is a portion of the 70' face which has not been finally incised ... only tentative possibilities suggested. The exposed portion of the 65' face embraces between stakes L-4 and R-1. The foreground block to the right of the picture supports the portion of Tomb #1 (Feature #3) in the 60-65' section. Note the almost vertical attitude of the loaded earth above this tomb in the 65' face indicative of the collapse of the roof of this structure. Immediately above this roof are bark lines that comprised Tomb #3 ... see the 65' Profile drawing. The flue-like projection from the center face of the 65' Profile supports a portion of the charred timbers above it and in the 65-70' section ... identified as Feature #2. The close-up of the 65' face reveals vertical evidence of several log-tombs. Note the primary dome of brightly loaded earth which has a thin layer of Old Humus beneath it. The upper central loads of this dome dip centrally toward the line which forms the floor of log Tomb #4 (Feature #37). These dipping loads indicate the collapsed roof over this tomb. The line indicating the floor of this tomb bisected the tomb and represents a vertical section of this tomb ... the portion in the 60-65' section was cut away without indication of a tomb at the time, and only the north half remains as yet unexposed in the next forward cut. The line indicating the tomb floor was covered with bark which showed in this face. Tomb #5 (Feature #4) is the first indicated in the 65' face. The first incised line above the top of the primary dome of Tomb #4 bore bark and the tilting and dipping of the earth loading above this line further evidenced Tomb #5 ... the collapsed earth roof of same, as yet unexposed.</abstract>
