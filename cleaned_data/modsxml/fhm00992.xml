      <title>207HS12 Patterson Site 71HS12, Humphreys County, Tennessee. Feature 1, Wall trench of Feature 1 ca. 15' below floor. Note many disturbed areas. Square 12R5. Direction north</title>
   </titleInfo>
   <abstract>For detailed drawing see Ground Plan. The purpose for which this structure was built seems rather vague, however, in some respects a Mississippi-like house form is indicated. The use of relatively deep wall trench, baked sections of floor and heavy wall and possibly roof daub are familiar. Variant features would be the oval shape of the wall trench, its irregularity with regard to depth and an apparent lack of posts; none could be truly identified by means of post molds, however, one or two charred log ends in the trench were very suggestive that posts had been used. Burning of the structure was very intense as the heavy layer of daub would indicate. Looters' pits were extremely numerous and had effectively destroyed much of the hoped-for evidence. (these are plotted on the ground plan). The wall trench pattern is very similar to Feature 2 trench and it is possible that they were identical structures. If this is true then the rock wall of Feature 2 was a later addition. Small sections of hard baked floor were found. Looters' pits had torn up much of the floor, while in other places there was no evidence as to why the floor did not remain. This floor indicated the occupational level of the structure. Wall trenches originated at the same level.</abstract>
